## Inspec Examples

### rSpec Explicit Subject

Here we have an InSpec test that lists out its current directory. Our original test code looks like this:

```ruby
describe command('ls -al').stdout.strip do
  it { should_not be_empty }
end
```

If we would like to have a more [Explicit Subject](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-core/docs/subject/explicit-subject) then we could refactor the code like this example

```ruby
describe "this is a detailed message" do
  subject { command('ls -al').stdout.strip }
  it{ should_not be_empty }
end
```

### Looping Through Data

For looping through a file directory, the directory resource is not powerful enough to do that, so we are required to use the `command` resource and run a `find` or it's equivalent for your target OS. This can be very resource intensive on your target, so try to be as specific as possible with your search such as the example below:

```ruby
command('find ~/* -type f -maxdepth 0 -xdev').stdout.split.each do |fname|
  describe file(fname) do
    its('owner') { should cmp 'ec2-user' }
  end
end
```

### The `should` vs. `expect` syntax

Users familiar with the RSpec testing framework may know that there are two ways to write test statements: `should` and `expect`. The RSpec community decided that `expect` is the preferred syntax.

InSpec recommends the `should` syntax as it tends to read more easily to those users who are not as technical, however there are times when the `expect` syntax will communicate much more clearly to the end-user.

InSpec will continue to support both methods of writing tests. Consider this file test:

```ruby
describe file('/tmp/test.txt') do
  it { should be_file }
end
```

This can be re-written with expect syntax

```ruby
describe file('/tmp/test.txt') do
  it 'should be a file' do
    expect(subject).to(be_file)
  end
end
```

The output of both of the above examples looks like this:

```sh
File /tmp/test.txt
   ✔  should be a file
```

In addition, you can make use of the `subject keyword` to further control your output if you choose:

```ruby
describe 'test file' do
  subject { file('/tmp/test.txt') }
  it 'should be a file' do
    expect(subject).to(be_file)
  end
end
```

… which will render the following output:

```sh
test file
  ✔  should be a fill
```

### `Expect syntax` and Password Hashes

Here we have an inspec test that checks if passwords are SHA512 hashes. As a quick thought exercise can you think of how we can adjust the control below to support SHA512 or higher assuming where you are testing uses SHA1024 or even SHA2048?

```ruby
bad_users = inspec.shadow.where { password != "*" && password != "!" && password !~ /\$6\$/ }.users

describe 'Password hashes in /etc/shadow' do
  it 'should only contain SHA512 hashes' do
    failure_message = "Users without SHA512 hashes: #{bad_users.join(', ')}"
    expect(bad_users).to be_empty, failure_message
  end
end
```
