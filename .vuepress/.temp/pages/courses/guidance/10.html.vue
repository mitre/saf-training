<p>With that, we've done two full requirements -- one &quot;Applicable - Configurable&quot; and one &quot;Applicable - Inherently Meets.&quot; There are only 189 or so more requirements to go!</p>
<p>In a real project of this size, you will be part of a team of authors each taking a subset of these requirements to complete. However, in a project of any size, you will also be peer reviewing the content your colleagues write to ensure quality standards are met.</p>

<p>Let's flag our completed RHEL-09-000003 requirement as Ready for Review.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the &quot;Review Status&quot; button at the top of the requirement window.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that we, as the primary author, are <em>not able to approve our own requirement;</em> the option is grayed out. All we can do is mark the requirement for review (or, as an admin, we can simply lock the control against further edits).</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Let's add a comment and click the radio button to designate this requirement as Ready for Review.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
<li>Click &quot;Submit Review&quot; when done.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the &quot;Reviews &amp; Comments&quot; section on the right hand side of the Component view has updated.</p>

<p>Note also that the control is locked from further editing now. We can reverse this using the Review Status menu if we want.</p>

<p>If you want to conduct a peer review on another author's requirements, you can do so by filtering the requirements using the filter bar on the left side of the Component view.</p>

<p>If you enter a control that has been marked for review, and you are at least the role of Reviewer on the project, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Approve: Lock the requirement for further editing; it is considered complete.</li>
<li>Request Changes: unlock the requirement for further edits</li>
</ul>
