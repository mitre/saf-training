User Manual for Vulcan -- notes 

This guide assumes that the user is logged into the website: https://mitre-vulcan-prod.herokuapp.com/ -- use the vulcan.mitre.org to write this out

-use the readme: https://github.com/mitre/saf-training-lab-environment#readme
-launch it locally (codespace training)
- for any ss, ![Alt text](../../assets/img/SAF_Capabilities_Validate.png) -- add them to the assets folder, rename them so you know what the ss is
- each step should be a separate page (for now)


Other important things to note:
*mention that you can revert changes in vulcan
*review process should be discussed (marked as 'for review', another user needs to peer-review)
*option to export content (formats are: disa specific, stubbed inspec profile (inspec tab))
*diff viewer to compare (duplicate component for ss) -- can work on next version w/o ruining the first one
*look into the revision history tab, if fail then blank page 

to-do:
*need a section for overlay components -- just make a blank page for it
