## 4. Starting The Project

### 4.1 Consider Your Application's Requirements
- What is the **goal** of the application?
- What type of security guidelines does it need?

### 4.2 Choosing an SRG
- At the top of the page, click the "SRGs" button.

- You'll need to decide which high level guidance you want to base your STIG off of. Or you can upload your own, as long as it's in XCCDF format or an XML document.

*Note: For this course, the "Application_Security_Development_STIG" is going to be chosen.

### 4.3 
- Now you can start your project, after outlining the needs of your application and choosing an SRG.

- At the top of the page, click the "Start New Project" button.

- Name your project, give it a description, and choose its visibility.

TODO: flesh out visibility concept

### 4.4 Optional: Adding Members to Your Project
* Optional: Once your project has been created, there's a tab titled "Members" where you can add users to your project and assign them a role.
- The types of roles include:

*Viewer: Read only access to the Project or Component

*Author: Edit, comment, and mark Controls as requiring review. Cannot sign-off or approve changes to a Control. Great for individual contributors.

*Reviewer: Author and approve changes to a Control.

*Admin: Full control of a Project or Component. Lock Controls, revert controls, and manage members.

TODO: briefly describe why we want a Reviewer role -- best practice to get peer review, etc.
