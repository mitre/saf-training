## Security Guidance

Before we go further, let's discuss what we mean by "security guidance" and some of its characteristics that matter to us as security (and automation!) practitioners.

**Security guidance** is human-readable content which defines what constitutes a secure configuration for a software component or category of components. It answers the important question that all developers and engineers ask when they want to secure their software -- "What counts as 'secure' for my system in the first place?"

Most software projects will (or at least *should*) align themselves to a particular source for security guidance and follow it as a baseline that answers this question. For example, many commercial companies (and even some civilian government agencies) use the Center for Internet Security Benchmarks (CIS Benchmarks) as their baseline, while software deployed by the US Department of Defense is required to comply with the Defense Information Systems Agency's Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs), broadly speaking. 

### Tailoring Guidance

Of course, if you have ever had to implement a security baseline for a software component before, you probably noticed that the baselines don't always line up exactly with the realities of your software's requirements. Securely configuring a software component often also means *decreasing its functionality* to the bare minimum in order to decrease the attack surface as much as possible.

It is also the case that many organizations that use popular secrity guidance documents as their baselines have their own organizational security policies that conflict with the baseline. For example, let's say that the STIG for the Red Hat operating system specifies that users should have, at minimum, 15 characters in their passwords, but your company's security policy requires a minimum of 20. 

### Finding Security Guidance Documentation Baselines

You are likely already familiar with some common sources of security guidance, such as the Center for Internet Security (which publishes CIS Benchmarks) and, on the government side, the Defense Information Systems Agency (which publishes Secure Technical Implementation Guides, or STIGs). 






### What Makes for Good Security Guidance?

This class intends to teach you how to create security guidance documentation for use as a blueprint for building secure software. We want to write **clear** and **easy-to-implement** guidance. We want to write guidance that considers **all common deployment strategies** for the software component we are deploying -- does my piece of software meaningfully change if it is deployed in the cloud as opposed to on-prem? What happens if I deploy it as a container?
