## 9.1 Automated Validation Tests

Now that we have written up some Check and Fix text, it's time to use one of Vulcan's other features -- the InSpec code pane.

We've already used Vulcan to generate a document that has most of the metadata in place that we would need to properly label an automated validation test. Now we can go the last mile or so to a complete security test.

### 9.1.1 The InSpec Control Body

1. Click on the InSpec Control Body tab in the requirement window.

![InSpec Control Body](@/../../../assets/img/control_body.png)

You'll see a code editing window directly in Vulcan. What we can do now is write in the test code we want to use for testing the check we just wrote.

::: warning Wait, what if I have no idea how to write InSpec code?!
Great news, we have an in-depth [training class](@/../../../courses/beginner/README.md) on how to do this ([two of them](@/../../../courses/advanced/README.md), actually).

But if you don't have the time for those, don't sweat it; we just want you to know that this is something you can do with Vulcan.

2. For demonstration purposes, we'll copy in the code from the actual MITRE SAF RHEL7 STIG InSpec profile[^rhel7_profile].

That code is as follows:
``` ruby
audit_command = '/etc/passwd'

if virtualization.system.eql?('docker')
  impact 0.0
  describe 'Control not applicable - audit config must be done on the host' do
    skip 'Control not applicable - audit config must be done on the host'
  end
else
  describe 'Command' do
    it "#{audit_command} is audited properly" do
      audit_rule = auditd.file(audit_command)
      expect(audit_rule).to exist
      expect(audit_rule.key).to cmp 'identity'
      expect(audit_rule.permissions.flatten).to include('w', 'a')
    end
  end
end
```

3. Go ahead and copy that code block and paste it into the editing window.

![InSpec Control](@/../../../assets/img/describe_block.png)

::: note
If you have taken the SAF User class, you have used `inspec exec` to run code that looks like the above against a target system.
:::

4. Save the requirement.

5. Now check the "InSpec Control (Read-Only)" tab. It has used the contents of the other two tabs to assemble a completed InSpec control from your requirement, including the complete context of your STIG control as metadata tags in the test.

![InSpec Control](@/../../../assets/img/inspec_full.png)

We can export this content and start using it immediately if we wish (we'll discuss how in a later section).
