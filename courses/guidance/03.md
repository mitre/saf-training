## 3. Security Resource Guidelines (SRGs)

### 3.1 Consider your applications requirements
- What is the goal of the application?
- What type of security guidlines does it need?

### 3.2 Choosing an SRG
- At the top of the page, click the "SRGs" button.

- You'll need to decide which high level guidance you want to base your STIG off of. Or you can upload your own, as long as it's in XCCDF format or an XML document.

*Note: For this course, the "Application_Security_Development_STIG" is going to be chosen.
