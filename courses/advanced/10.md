## More Pipeline Steps

Let's make this pipeline deploy, harden, validate, and verify an NGINX container.

### Prep Steps

First, we need to make sure that the node that runs our pipeline will have access to the executables it needs. By default, Gitub's runners have quite a bit of software pre-installed, including Docker and Ansible (see the full list [here](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/linux/Ubuntu2004-Readme.md)). However, the Ubuntu image we are using does not have InSpec installed, nor does it have a copy of our test code. Let's add to our pipeline file to fix this.

::: code-tabs#shell
@tab Adding More Steps
``` yaml
- name: PREP - Install InSpec executable 
  run: curl https://omnitruck.chef.io/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -P inspec -v 5

- name: PREP - Check out this repository  # because that's where our profile is!
  uses: actions/checkout@v3
```
@tab `pipeline.yml` after adding more steps
``` yaml
name: Demo Security Validation Gold Image Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main] # trigger this action on any push to main branch

jobs:
  gold-image:
    name: Gold Image NGINX
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    env:
      CHEF_LICENSE: accept # so that we can use InSpec without manually accepting the license
      PROFILE: my_nginx # path to our profile
    steps:
      - name: PREP - Update runner # updating all dependencies is always a good start
        run: sudo apt-get update

      - name: PREP - Install InSpec executable 
        run: curl https://omnitruck.chef.io/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -P inspec -v 5

      - name: PREP - Check out this repository  # because that's where our profile is!
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
```
:::

The first new step installs the InSpec executable using the install instructions for Ubuntu as given [here](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/install/#cli-1). Remember that GitHub gives us a brand-new runner node every time we execute the pipeline; if we don't install it and it isn't on the pre-installed software list, it won't be available!

### Actions

The next step ("PREP - Check out this repository") is our first one to use an Action. Actions are pre-packaged pipeline steps published to the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=). Any project or developer can publish an Action to the Marketplace as part of the GitHub Actions ecosystem. Most other orchestration tools for pipelines have a similar plugin system.

We can use Actions as shortcuts in the same way we use InSpec resources to abstract out quite a bit of test code logic. Actions are invoked with the `uses` attribute in a step in place of the `run` attribute we have been using so far, which simply executes a terminal command.

This Action in particular is one of the most common -- [`checkout`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/checkout). If called with no other attributes attached to it, it simply checks out and changes directory into the repository where the workflow file lives to the runner that is currently executing the workflow. We need to do this to make sure we have access to InSpec profile you created earlier!

### Linting

Most CI pipelines will also include a lint step, where the code is statically tested to make sure that it does not contain errors that we can spot before we even execute it, and to make sure it is conforming to a project style guide. For our purposes, it's a good idea to run the `inspec check` command to ensure that InSpec can recognize our tests as a real profile.

::: Note We can run InSpec inside this runner now because we installed it in a prior step!
:::

Let's add the lint step:

::: code-tabs#shell
@tab Adding Lint Step
``` yaml
- name: LINT - Run InSpec Check           # double-check that we don't have any serious issues in our profile code
  run: inspec check $PROFILE
```
@tab `pipeline.yml` after adding lint step
``` yaml
name: Demo Security Validation Gold Image Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main] # trigger this action on any push to main branch

jobs:
  gold-image:
    name: Gold Image NGINX
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    env:
      CHEF_LICENSE: accept # so that we can use InSpec without manually accepting the license
      PROFILE: my_nginx # path to our profile
    steps:
      - name: PREP - Update runner # updating all dependencies is always a good start
        run: sudo apt-get update

      - name: PREP - Install InSpec executable 
        run: curl https://omnitruck.chef.io/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -P inspec -v 5

      - name: PREP - Check out this repository  # because that's where our profile is!
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        
      - name: LINT - Run InSpec Check           # double-check that we don't have any serious issues in our profile code
        run: inspec check $PROFILE
```
:::

### Deploy Test Container

We now have `inspec exec` and the `my_nginx` profile available in our pipeline. Now we need the image we're going to harden.

Luckily, the Ubuntu runner we are using already has the Docker Engine installed, so we can deploy a container easily. We will deploy the same container image we have been using in this class so far. We will also name it `nginx` to keep things consistent, but recall that this container is running on a GitHub cloud runner, not inside your codespace like your local containers we've been using for prior classwork.

We'll also need to make sure that our test target has Python installed, since that's how Ansible will connect to it later to harden it.

(You didn't have to do that for your local NGINX container because the `build-lab.sh` script did all that config for you.)

::: code-tabs#shell
@tab Adding Deploy Steps
``` yaml
- name: DEPLOY - Run a Docker container from nginx
  run: docker run -dit --name nginx nginx:latest

- name: DEPLOY - Install Python for our nginx container
  run: |
    docker exec nginx apt-get update -y
    docker exec nginx apt-get install -y python3
```
@tab `pipeline.yml` after adding deploy steps
``` yaml
name: Demo Security Validation Gold Image Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main] # trigger this action on any push to main branch

jobs:
  gold-image:
    name: Gold Image NGINX
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    env:
      CHEF_LICENSE: accept # so that we can use InSpec without manually accepting the license
      PROFILE: my_nginx # path to our profile
    steps:
      - name: PREP - Update runner # updating all dependencies is always a good start
        run: sudo apt-get update

      - name: PREP - Install InSpec executable 
        run: curl https://omnitruck.chef.io/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -P inspec -v 5

      - name: PREP - Check out this repository  # because that's where our profile is!
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        
      - name: LINT - Run InSpec Check           # double-check that we don't have any serious issues in our profile code
        run: inspec check $PROFILE

      - name: DEPLOY - Run a Docker container from nginx
        run: docker run -dit --name nginx nginx:latest

      - name: DEPLOY - Install Python for our nginx container
        run: |
          docker exec nginx apt-get update -y
          docker exec nginx apt-get install -y python3
```

You can run a multiline script in a single `run` step by passing it as a multiline string, which is denoted with a pipe character (`|`).

### Hardening

Alright, if our pipeline makes it this far, then we have installed InSpec, pulled our profile, checked it for errors, and deployed a test target. It's time to harden the target.

In our case, we're going to borrow an open-source Ansible role for NGINX that is part of the [SAF Hardening Library](https://saf.mitre.org/libs/harden). If you took the [SAF User Class](../user/README.md), you might recognize this role as what you ran manually during the [Hardening](../user/10.md) section of that class. Again, we are borrowing some of the steps from the lab setup script and executing them against our runner system, for convenience.

Let's add the Hardening steps now.

::: code-tabs#shell
@tab Adding Harden Steps
``` yaml
- name: HARDEN - Fetch Ansible role
  run: |
    git clone --branch docker https://github.com/mitre/ansible-nginx-stigready-hardening.git || true
    chmod 755 ansible-nginx-stigready-hardening

- name: HARDEN - Fetch Ansible requirements
  run: ansible-galaxy install -r ansible-nginx-stigready-hardening/requirements.yml

- name: HARDEN - Run Ansible hardening
  run: ansible-playbook --inventory=nginx, --connection=docker ansible-nginx-stigready-hardening/hardening-playbook.yml
```
@tab `pipeline.yml` after adding hardening steps
``` yaml
name: Demo Security Validation Gold Image Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main] # trigger this action on any push to main branch

jobs:
  gold-image:
    name: Gold Image NGINX
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    env:
      CHEF_LICENSE: accept # so that we can use InSpec without manually accepting the license
      PROFILE: my_nginx # path to our profile
    steps:
      - name: PREP - Update runner # updating all dependencies is always a good start
        run: sudo apt-get update

      - name: PREP - Install InSpec executable 
        run: curl https://omnitruck.chef.io/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -P inspec -v 5

      - name: PREP - Check out this repository  # because that's where our profile is!
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        
      - name: LINT - Run InSpec Check           # double-check that we don't have any serious issues in our profile code
        run: inspec check $PROFILE

      - name: DEPLOY - Run a Docker container from nginx
        run: docker run -dit --name nginx nginx:latest

      - name: DEPLOY - Install Python for our nginx container
        run: |
          docker exec nginx apt-get update -y
          docker exec nginx apt-get install -y python3
      - name: HARDEN - Fetch Ansible role
        run: |
          git clone --branch docker https://github.com/mitre/ansible-nginx-stigready-hardening.git || true
          chmod 755 ansible-nginx-stigready-hardening

      - name: HARDEN - Fetch Ansible requirements
        run: ansible-galaxy install -r ansible-nginx-stigready-hardening/requirements.yml

      - name: HARDEN - Run Ansible hardening
        run: ansible-playbook --inventory=nginx, --connection=docker ansible-nginx-stigready-hardening/hardening-playbook.yml
```

### Validation

Time for the main event. Our gold image container should now be hardened, but we need to *prove it*.

Let's run InSpec:

::: code-tabs#shell
@tab Adding Validate Steps
``` yaml
- name: VALIDATE - Run InSpec
  continue-on-error: true                 # we dont want to stop if our InSpec run finds failures, we want to continue and record the result
  run: |
    inspec exec $PROFILE \
    --input-file=$PROFILE/inputs.yml \
    --target docker://nginx \
    --reporter cli json:results/pipeline_run.json

- name: VALIDATE - Save Test Result JSON  # save our results to the pipeline artifacts, even if the InSpec run found failing tests
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    path: results/pipeline_run.json
```
@tab `pipeline.yml` after adding validate steps
``` yaml
name: Demo Security Validation Gold Image Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main] # trigger this action on any push to main branch

jobs:
  gold-image:
    name: Gold Image NGINX
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    env:
      CHEF_LICENSE: accept # so that we can use InSpec without manually accepting the license
      PROFILE: my_nginx # path to our profile
    steps:
      - name: PREP - Update runner # updating all dependencies is always a good start
        run: sudo apt-get update

      - name: PREP - Install InSpec executable 
        run: curl https://omnitruck.chef.io/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -P inspec -v 5

      - name: PREP - Check out this repository  # because that's where our profile is!
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        
      - name: LINT - Run InSpec Check           # double-check that we don't have any serious issues in our profile code
        run: inspec check $PROFILE

      - name: DEPLOY - Run a Docker container from nginx
        run: docker run -dit --name nginx nginx:latest

      - name: DEPLOY - Install Python for our nginx container
        run: |
          docker exec nginx apt-get update -y
          docker exec nginx apt-get install -y python3
      - name: HARDEN - Fetch Ansible role
        run: |
          git clone --branch docker https://github.com/mitre/ansible-nginx-stigready-hardening.git || true
          chmod 755 ansible-nginx-stigready-hardening

      - name: HARDEN - Fetch Ansible requirements
        run: ansible-galaxy install -r ansible-nginx-stigready-hardening/requirements.yml

      - name: HARDEN - Run Ansible hardening
        run: ansible-playbook --inventory=nginx, --connection=docker ansible-nginx-stigready-hardening/hardening-playbook.yml
        
      - name: VALIDATE - Run InSpec
        continue-on-error: true                 # we dont want to stop if our InSpec run finds failures, we want to continue and record the result
        run: |
          inspec exec $PROFILE \
          --input-file=$PROFILE/inputs.yml \
          --target docker://nginx \
          --reporter cli json:results/pipeline_run.json
      - name: VALIDATE - Save Test Result JSON  # save our results to the pipeline artifacts, even if the InSpec run found failing tests
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: results/pipeline_run.json
```
:::

You may notice that the step that runs InSpec sets an attribute called `continue-on-error` to `true`. We'll discuss why we do that in the next section. 

::: note Where are we in the directory structure right now?!
Remember that we used the `checkout` action earlier, so the pipeline is currently running inside the root of our repo as it exists on the runner system. That's why we can refer to files in this repo by local paths (like the profile repo itself, and the `results` subdirectory).
:::

### Artifacts

We used the `--reporter json` flag when we invoked InSpec, so we should now have a report file sitting on the runner. We want to be able to access that file -- both so that we can read it ourselves, and so that we can do some later processing on it in later jobs if we want to.

That's why we used `upload-artifact`, another extremely common Action. This one makes whatever file or files you pass it available for download through the browser when we examine the pipeline run later, and also makes those files available to later jobs even if they take place on different runners in this workflow (by default, any files created by a runner do not persist when the workflow ends).

::: details Any Other Steps?
Let's do some brainstorming -- are there any other steps you'd like to insert into the pipeline? What else do you want to know about the profile or do with it?
