- Some background info on GH Actions and why they are useful
		- Show them what a completed workflow file looks like as a code sample and also a diagram. REFER BACK TO DIAGRAM FREQUENTLY
	- Show ANOTHER DIAGRAM that describes where the workflow action file sits in the repo and how it relates to the actual repository code
	- Stress that GH Actions are one of MANY pipeline software solutions
		- obvious parallels are GitLab pipelines, DroneCI, Jenkins
		- Ask people what stuff they've used to automate before, have SAF team members give some war stories, etc.
