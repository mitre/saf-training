### 5.1. Pipeline example 

Below is a [RedHat 7 example](https://github.com/mitre/redhat-enterprise-linux-7-stig-baseline/blob/master/.github/workflows/verify-ec2.yml) of an automated pipeline that creates and configures two machines with the RedHat 7 operating system - one of which is set up as a vanilla configuration, and one of which is hardened using hardening scripts run by the Chef configuration management tool called kitchen. 

:::info Modularity in Automation
We will demonstrate the automation process through this example, but note that the different orchestration tools, configuration mangement tools, and targets can be traded out for different uses while following the same automation flow and security automation framework.

```yaml
name: EC2 Testing Matrix

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  my-job:
    name: Validate my profile
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      CHEF_LICENSE: accept-silent
      KITCHEN_LOCAL_YAML: kitchen.ec2.yml
    strategy:
      matrix:
        suite: ['vanilla', 'hardened']
      fail-fast: false
    steps:
      - name: add needed packages
        run: sudo apt-get install -y jq
      - name: Configure AWS credentials
        env:
          AWS_SG_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_SG_ID }}
          AWS_SUBNET_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_SUBNET_ID }}
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: us-east-1
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Clone full repository so we can push
        run: git fetch --prune --unshallow
      - name: Setup Ruby
        uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
        with:
          ruby-version: '2.7'
      - name: Disable ri and rdoc
        run: 'echo "gem: --no-ri --no-rdoc" >> ~/.gemrc'
      - run: bundle install
      - name: Regenerate current `profile.json`
        run: |
          bundle exec inspec json . | jq . > profile.json
      - name: Lint the Inspec profile
        run: bundle exec inspec check .
      - name: Run kitchen test
        run: bundle exec kitchen test --destroy=always ${{ matrix.suite }}-rhel-7 || true
      - name: Display our ${{ matrix.suite }} results summary
        uses: mitre/saf_action@v1
        with:
          command_string: 'view:summary -i spec/results/ec2_rhel-7_${{ matrix.suite }}.json'
      - name: Ensure the scan meets our ${{ matrix.suite }} results threshold
        uses: mitre/saf_action@v1
        with:
          command_string: 'validate:threshold -i spec/results/ec2_rhel-7_${{ matrix.suite }}.json -F ${{ matrix.suite }}.threshold.yml'
      - name: Save Test Result JSON
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          path: spec/results/
```

The two machines are then tested, which runs an InSpec profile. The results are viewed and validated against a threshold to allow the pipeline to automatically pass or fail based on whether the results meet those thresholds. The SAF CLI is used to view and validate.

:::tip Use Examples to Help Automate
To get more information on setting up the whole automation pipeline for your use case, use examples, such as the [RedHat 7 repository](https://github.com/mitre/redhat-enterprise-linux-7-stig-baseline/). You can view results of the workflows in the [Actions tab](https://github.com/mitre/redhat-enterprise-linux-7-stig-baseline/actions).

### 5.2. SAF CLI GitHub Action 

The SAF has several ways of easing the automation process. If you are using a GitHub pipeline, such as this example, you can use the [SAF CLI GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/saf-cli-action).
