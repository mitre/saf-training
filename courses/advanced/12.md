	- Add a step that saves the output of validate job as an artifact 
		- note that this step should ALWAYS run, we want to save even a failed result so we can diagnose issues
	- Use the [SAF action](https://github.com/mitre/saf_action) for verifying results
		- use as a segue to talking about saving jobs as building blocks for other jobs
			- describe how you can write template files in gitlab that do the same thing.
		- write up a threshold file to define what a successful run is
