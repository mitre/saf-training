## InSpec Content Review

In the [beginner class](../beginner/README.md), we explained the structure and output of InSpec Profiles. Let's review some content, then practice by revisiting, running, and viewing results of an InSpec profile.

### InSpec Profile Structure
Remember that a `profile` is a set of automated tests that usually relates directly back to a Security Requirements Benchmark.

Profiles have two (2) **required** elements:
- An `inspec.yml` file 
- A `controls` directory

and **optional** elements such as: 
- A `libraries` directory 
- A `files` directory
- An `inputs.yml` file 
- A `README.md` file

InSpec can create the profile structure for you using the following command:

```sh
$ inspec init profile my_inspec_profile
```

This will give you the required files along with some optional files.

```sh
$ tree my_inspec_profile

  my_inspec_profile
  ├── README.md
  ├── controls
  │   └── example.rb
  └── inspec.yml
```

### Default File Structures

#### Control File Structure

Let's take a look at the default ruby file in the `controls` directory.

::: code-tabs
@tab controls/example.rb

```ruby
title 'sample section'

# you can also use plain tests
describe file('/tmp') do
  it { should be_directory }
end

# you add controls here
control 'tmp-1.0' do                        # A unique ID for this control
  impact 0.7                                # The criticality, if this control fails.
  title 'Create /tmp directory'             # A human-readable title
  desc 'An optional description...'
  describe file('/tmp') do                  # The actual test
    it { should be_directory }
  end
end
```
:::

This example shows two tests. Both tests check for the existence of the `/tmp` directory. The second test provides additional information about the test. Let's break down each component.

- `control` (line 9) is followed by the control's name. Each control in a profile has a unique name.
- `impact` (line 10) measures the relative importance of the test and must be a value between 0.0 and 1.0.
- `title` (line 11) defines the control's purpose.
- `desc` (line 12) provides a more complete description of what the control checks for.
- `describe` (lines 13 — 15) defines the test. Here, the test checks for the existence of the `/tmp` directory.

#### Describe Block Structure

As with many test frameworks, InSpec code resembles natural language. Here's the format of a describe block.

```ruby
describe < entity > do
  it { < expectation > }
end
```

::: tip Resources And Matchers
::: tabs

@tab Resources
InSpec uses resources like the `file` resource to aid in control development. These resources can often be used as the `< entity >` in the describe block. Find a list of resources in the [InSpec documentation ](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/resources/)

@tab Matchers
InSpec uses matchers like the `cmp` or `eq` to aid in control development. These matchers can often be used as the `< expectation >` in the describe block where the expectation is checking a requirement of that entity. Find a list of matchers in the [InSpec documentation ](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/matchers/)

#### inspec.yml File Structure

Let's take a look at the default `inspec.yml`.

::: code-tabs
@tab inspec.yml

```yaml
name: my_inspec_profile
title: InSpec Profile
maintainer: The Authors
copyright: The Authors
copyright_email: you@example.com
license: Apache-2.0
summary: An InSpec Compliance Profile
version: 0.1.0
supports:
  platform: os

# Optional sections

depends:
  - name: < name of the profile from which you can include controls >
    path: < relative path to that profile >

gem_dependencies:
  - name: < name of the gem >
    version: < version of the gem >

inputs:
  - name: < name of the input >
    desc: < description of the input >
    type: < data type of the input (String, Array, Numeric, Hash) >
    value: < default value for the input >
```
:::

This example shows default metadata of the InSpec profile along with the optional sections. Find more information about [inputs](../beginner/06.md) and [overlays](../beginner/10.md) in the beginner class.

::: tip
`version` (line 8) is the version of that inspec profile. The best practice is for the version to be bumped after making changes to the profile to pull the latest updates.

::: details Difference between 'inspec.yml' and 'inputs.yml'

| inspec.yml                                                    |     inputs.yml  |

| Should not be renamed                                         |      Can be renamed  |
| Needs to be at the root of the profile                        |    Can be anywhere  |
| Automatically used during execution<br>`inspec exec profile1` |   Needs to be passed in during execution<br>`inspec exec profile1 --input-file <path>`  |
| Purpose is to define default input values and profile metadata |  Purpose is to override default input values with parameters for the local environments  |
| Defined by the author of the profile                          | Defined by the user of the profile |
