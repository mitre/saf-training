### 7.1. Local Resource
Local resources exist only in the profile they are developed in. As was shown in the previous example, a local resource would be placed in the `libraries` directory
```bash
$ tree examples/profile
examples/profile
...
├── libraries
│   └── custom_resource.rb
```

From there you would develop your custom resource `custom_resource.rb` and be able to utilize the resource within that profile.

### 7.2. Built-in InSpec Resource
Sometimes when working on resources you may find a gap in InSpec where a resource doesn't exist where it should. In a situation such as that you may want to develop a resource for upstream InSpec in Github. When developing a resource for InSpec you touch a few more files than just the `custom_resource.rb` as mentioned before.

First you would have to fork a copy of the [InSpec Github Repo](https://github.com/inspec/inspec) to make the necessary changes to the repository.

The following directories are the ones you would want to change:

For the actual resource you can place it in `lib/inspec/resources/`.

You have to add your new resource to the helper file in `lib/inspec/resources.rb`

Then you have to write out your integration tests for the resource in this directory `test/integration/default/controls/`

Next you are required to write the unit tests for your new resource here `test/unit/resources/`

Finally, you will have to write up the documentation that will be put up on InSpec's official doc page here `docs/resources/`
