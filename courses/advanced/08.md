- Section N: CI/CD Pipelines (suggest to borrow content from Will's explanation of what the SAF is for interns, lives [here](https://app.gitbook.com/o/FbC5imoOf30TsP3Ma5Is/s/GvZrmOgiXEqRNzarOLFD/onboarding-info/what-is-the-saf))
	- **WHAT(/WHY)** is a pipeline? --> briefly, we make pipelines for the same reason Henry Ford made the assembly line; it makes processes repeatable, consistent, and automated wherever possible
	- define CI/CD
		- Use Will's definitions from GitBook(?):
			- CI - Test code before committing it to a central repository ("continuous integration", CI)
			- CD - Release a new iteration of the codebase on a frequent basis ("continuous delivery", CD)
	- What tools can I use in a pipeline? --> anything you want!
		- We use InSpec for X Y Z purposes in our pipelines
	- USE CASE -- describe the use case we will be following for this class. We will assume that we are engineers trying to build a GOLD IMAGE PIPELINE for an NGINX container image.
		- We need to:
			- Take a base container image (same one as whatever we use in the lab for testing)
			- harden it (use ansible and the https://saf.mitre.org/libs/harden content for NGINX. . .?)
			- validate the hardening by running either the full profile we developed from the beginner class or the actual SAF profile for NGINX
			- verify that the hardening reached a threshold of success (saf cli)
		- should probably describe other common use cases for CI/CD pipelines, like managing IaC in more complex environments
	- Pipelines are broken into JOBS. The JOBS we need in a common pipeline include but are not limited to:
			- Prep (Configure Runner, do stuff like `yum update`)
			- Lint Code (in our case `inspec check .`, maybe a rubocop run)
			- deploy test suite (in our case, the hardened and vanilla boxes we want to test, but more generally, this means pulling and deploying the application you are testing)
			- configure the test suite (i.e. harden one of 'em)
			- validate
			- verify
			- do something with results -- if we passed do X, if not do Y
