## Custom Resource - Docker

Now let's try a more complicated example. Let's say we want to create a resource that can parse a `docker-compose` file.

### Create new profile and setup Docker files
First, we need a test target! Check out the `resources/docker-compose.yml` file in Codespaces for what we can test. It looks like this:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  workstation:
    container_name: workstation
    image: learnchef/inspec_workstation
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true
    links:
      - target
    volumes:
      - .:/root
  target:
    image: learnchef/inspec_target
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true
```

We will continue writing our controls to check against this docker file:

::: code-tabs

@tab Command
```bash
inspec init profile docker-workstations
```
@tab Output
```bash
 ─────────────────────────── InSpec Code Generator ─────────────────────────── 

Creating new profile at /workspaces/saf-training-lab-environment/docker-workstations
 • Creating file inspec.yml
 • Creating directory /workspaces/saf-training-lab-environment/docker-workstations/controls
 • Creating file controls/example.rb
 • Creating file README.md
```
:::

### Develop controls to test/run profile
In the `docker-workstations/controls/example.rb` file, write the control:

```ruby
describe yaml('file_name') do
  its('setting') { should_not eq 'value' }
end
```

We test early and often. Remember that the command line output can help guide your development!

::: code-tabs

@tab Command
```bash
inspec exec docker-workstations
```

@tab Output
```bash
Profile:   InSpec Profile (docker-workstations)
Version:   0.1.0
Target:    local://
Target ID: 6dcb9e6f-5ede-5474-9521-595fadf5c7ce

  YAML file_name
     ↺  Can't find file: file_name

Test Summary: 0 successful, 0 failures, 1 skipped
```
:::

We need to replace the `file_name` above with the location of the `docker-compose.yml` file. We also need to change the `setting` to grab the tag we want to retrieve. Finally we need to change `value` with the actual value as shown in the docker compose file.

```ruby
describe yaml('/path/to/docker-compose.yml') do
  its(['services', 'workstation', 'image']) { should eq 'learnchef/inspec_workstation' }
  its(['services', 'workstation', 'volumes']) { should cmp '.:/root' }
end
```

Now if we test this control using the following command we should see all the tests pass.

::: code-tabs

@tab Command
```bash
inspec exec docker-workstations
```

@tab Output
```bash
Profile:   InSpec Profile (docker-workstations)
Version:   0.1.0
Target:    local://
Target ID: 6dcb9e6f-5ede-5474-9521-595fadf5c7ce

  YAML /workspaces/saf-training-lab-environment/resources/docker-compose.yml
     ✔  ["services", "workstation", "image"] is expected to eq "learnchef/inspec_workstation"
     ✔  ["services", "workstation", "volumes"] is expected to cmp == ".:/root"

Test Summary: 2 successful, 0 failures, 0 skipped
```
:::

:::danger If you received an error above! - Concept Check

If you saw this as your output:
```bash
Profile:   InSpec Profile (docker-workstations)
Version:   0.1.0
Target:    local://
Target ID: 6dcb9e6f-5ede-5474-9521-595fadf5c7ce

  YAML /path/to/docker-compose.yml
     ↺  Can't find file: /path/to/docker-compose.yml

Test Summary: 0 successful, 0 failures, 1 skipped
```

It is because you did not give YOUR path to the docker-compose file. You need to replace the path in your `example.rb` file to be something like this:

```ruby
describe yaml('/workspaces/saf-training-lab-environment/resources/docker-compose.yml') do
  its(['services', 'workstation', 'image']) { should eq 'learnchef/inspec_workstation' }
  its(['services', 'workstation', 'volumes']) { should cmp '.:/root' }
end
```
:::

### Rewrite test to utilize resource
Going back to the control, we will write it using a resource that doesn't exist called docker-compose-config that is going to take a path as a parameter. 

:::details Test Driven Development
Remember the idea of Test Driven Development (TDD), the red-green-clean cycle. This way of development is driven by the tests. In this way, you know when you have succeeded while developing something new! In other words, before writing a solution, first write the test (which will fail - red), so that you know exactly what the expectation should be and when you have achieved it. Then you can write the solution to make the test pass (green). Finally, clean up the solution to make it easy to read and efficient!

::: code-tabs

@tab Tests
```ruby
describe yaml('/workspaces/saf-training-lab-environment/resources/docker-compose.yml') do
  its(['services', 'workstation', 'image']) { should eq 'learnchef/inspec_workstation' }
  its(['services', 'workstation', 'volumes']) { should cmp '.:/root' }
end

describe docker_compose_config('/workspaces/saf-training-lab-environment/resources/docker-compose.yml') do
  its('services.workstation.image') { should eq 'learnchef/inspec_workstation' }
  its('services.workstation.volumes') { should cmp '.:/root' }
end
```

@tab Generic Tests
```ruby
describe yaml('/path/to/docker-compose.yml') do
  its(['services', 'workstation', 'image']) { should eq 'learnchef/inspec_workstation' }
  its(['services', 'workstation', 'volumes']) { should cmp '.:/root' }
end

describe docker_compose_config('/path/to/docker-compose.yml') do
  its('services.workstation.image') { should eq 'learnchef/inspec_workstation' }
  its('services.workstation.volumes') { should cmp '.:/root' }
end
```
:::

Now we should see an error if we go back to terminal and run the same command to execute a scan

::: code-tabs

@tab Command
```bash
inspec exec docker-workstations
```
@tab Output
```bash
[2023-02-22T18:37:03+00:00] ERROR: Failed to load profile docker-workstations: Failed to load source for controls/example.rb: undefined method `docker_compose_config' for #<Inspec::ControlEvalContext:0x000000000593bb10>

```
:::

We should get an error saying the `docker_compose_config` method does not yet exist. That's because we have not yet defined this resource.

### Develop the Docker resource
In the `libraries` directory of the profile we will make a `docker_compose_config.rb` file, , the content of the file should look like this:

```ruby
# encoding: utf-8
# copyright: 2019, The Authors

class DockerComposeConfig < Inspec.resource(1)

  name 'docker_compose_config'

end
```

:::tip Using InSpec Init to Create the Resource
Alternatively, you can use `inspec init resource <your-resource-name>` to create the template for your custom resource. However, make sure you check that the "lib" folder is renamed to "libraries", or that InSpec recognizes the location of your custom resource.
:::

Now when we save and run the profile again using:

::: code-tabs

@tab Command
```bash
inspec exec docker-workstations
```

@tab Output
```bash
[2023-02-22T18:38:40+00:00] ERROR: Failed to load profile docker-workstations: Failed to load source for controls/example.rb: wrong number of arguments (given 1, expected 0)

     No tests executed.

Test Summary: 0 successful, 0 failures, 0 skipped
```
:::

We will get an error saying we gave it the wrong number of arguments: `was given 1 but expected 0`. This is because every class in Ruby that has a parameter must have an initialize function to accept that parameter.

```ruby
# encoding: utf-8
# copyright: 2019, The Authors

class DockerComposeConfig < Inspec.resource(1)

  name 'docker_compose_config'

  def initialize(path)
    @path = path
  end

end
```

Now let's run the profile once more.

::: code-tabs

@tab Command
```bash
inspec exec docker-workstations
```

@tab Output
```bash
Profile:   InSpec Profile (docker-workstations)
Version:   0.1.0
Target:    local://

  YAML /workspaces/saf-training-lab-environment/resources/docker-compose.yml
     ✔  ["services", "workstation", "image"] is expected to eq "learnchef/inspec_workstation"
     ✔  ["services", "workstation", "volumes"] is expected to cmp == ".:/root"
  docker_compose_config
     ×  services.workstation.image 
     undefined method `services' for #<#<Class:0x00000000050205a8>:0x00000000032cbbd8>
     ×  services.workstation.volumes 
     undefined method `services' for #<#<Class:0x00000000050205a8>:0x00000000032cbbd8>

Test Summary: 2 successful, 2 failures, 0 skipped
```
:::

This time the profile runs, but we get a message that the `docker_compose_config` resource does not have the `services` method. So let's define that method now:

```ruby
# encoding: utf-8
# copyright: 2019, The Authors

class DockerComposeConfig < Inspec.resource(1)

  name 'docker_compose_config'

  def initialize(path)
    @path = path
  end

  def services

  end

end
```

Start by just defining the `services` method. Then, let's run the profile once more.

::: code-tabs
@tab Command
```bash
inspec exec docker-workstations
```

@tab Output
```bash
Profile:   InSpec Profile (docker-workstations)
Version:   0.1.0
Target:    local://
Target ID: 6dcb9e6f-5ede-5474-9521-595fadf5c7ce

  YAML /workspaces/saf-training-lab-environment/resources/docker-compose.yml
     ✔  ["services", "workstation", "image"] is expected to eq "learnchef/inspec_workstation"
     ✔  ["services", "workstation", "volumes"] is expected to cmp == ".:/root"
  docker_compose_config
     ×  services.workstation.image 
     undefined method `workstation' for nil:NilClass
     ×  services.workstation.volumes 
     undefined method `workstation' for nil:NilClass

Test Summary: 2 successful, 2 failures, 0 skipped
```
:::

Now we got a different failure that tells us a `nil` value was returned. So now we will go ahead and define the services method. We will use an already existing InSpec resource to parse the path file.

```ruby
# encoding: utf-8
# copyright: 2019, The Authors

class DockerComposeConfig < Inspec.resource(1)

  name 'docker_compose_config'

  def initialize(path)
    @path = path
    @yaml = inspec.yaml(path)
  end

  def services
    @yaml['services']
  end

end
```

Now let's run the profile once more.

::: code-tabs
@tab Command
```bash
inspec exec docker-workstations
```

@tab Output
```bash
Profile:   InSpec Profile (docker-workstations)
Version:   0.1.0
Target:    local://
Target ID: 6dcb9e6f-5ede-5474-9521-595fadf5c7ce

  YAML /workspaces/saf-training-lab-environment/resources/docker-compose.yml
     ✔  ["services", "workstation", "image"] is expected to eq "learnchef/inspec_workstation"
     ✔  ["services", "workstation", "volumes"] is expected to cmp == ".:/root"
  docker_compose_config
     ×  services.workstation.image 
     undefined method `workstation' for <Hash:0x0000000003abada8>
     ×  services.workstation.volumes 
     undefined method `workstation' for <Hash:0x0000000003abada8>

Test Summary: 2 successful, 2 failures, 0 skipped
```
:::

You will notice that it parses correctly, but instead of our result we end up getting a hash. We need to convert the hash into an object that appears like other objects so that we may use our dot notation. So we will wrap our hash in a Ruby class called a `Hashie::Mash`. This gives us a quick way to convert a hash into a Ruby object with a number of methods attached to it. You will have to import the Hashie library by running `gem install hashie` and import it in the resource file to be used. It and is written as follows:

```ruby
# encoding: utf-8
# copyright: 2019, The Authors

require "hashie/mash"

class DockerComposeConfig < Inspec.resource(1)

  name 'docker_compose_config'

  def initialize(path)
    @path = path
    @yaml = inspec.yaml(path)
  end

  def services
    Hashie::Mash.new(@yaml['services'])
  end

end
```

Lets run the profile again.

```bash
