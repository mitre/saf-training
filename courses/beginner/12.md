## Getting Started on the RHEL8 Baseline

Let's practice writing a few 'real' controls using a security guidance document.

#### The Steps to write an InSpec Control
1. **Read the Control** - Go to the control (you made from the stub generator) and read the check text to understand the goal of the control
2. **Look for Key Words and Resources** - Look for key words that would indicate what resource to use. If you can't find it, look at the [resources page](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/resources/) and compare back to the control.
3. **Read the documentation** - Look at the documentation for the resource you need and understand the syntax and checkout some examples.
4. **Write the test** 
5. **Run the test** 
6. **Troubleshoot errors** If you have syntax errors or unexpected results, it's time to troubleshoot. The best first step in troubleshooting is to _read the error message_ from the command line. 

### Example Control Using `login_defs` Resource:

Let's go through an example using control SV-230324 to see the above steps in practice.

1. **Read the control** - when referencing the control SV-230324 from the stub profile that was generated with the stub generator, look at the control, especially the check text, to understand the intention of the security guidance for this control.
**This control** is talking about verifying all local interactive users are assigned a home directory upon creation.

::: code-tabs#shell

@tab Stub Generated Control
```ruby
control "SV-230324" do
  title "All RHEL 8 local interactive user accounts must be assigned a home directory upon creation."
  desc "If local interactive users are not assigned a valid home directory, there is no place for the 
storage and control of files they should own."
  desc "check", "Verify all local interactive users on RHEL 8 are assigned a home directory upon creation with 
the following command:

$ sudo grep -i create_home /etc/login.defs

CREATE_HOME yes

If 
the value for \"CREATE_HOME\" parameter is not set to \"yes\", the line is missing, or the line is 
commented out, this is a finding."
  desc "fix", "Configure RHEL 8 to assign home directories to all new local interactive users by setting the 
\"CREATE_HOME\" parameter in \"/etc/login.defs\" to \"yes\" as follows.

CREATE_HOME yes"
  impact 0.5
  tag severity: "medium"
  tag gtitle: "SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227"
  tag gid: "V-230324"
  tag rid: "SV-230324r627750_rule"
  tag stig_id: "RHEL-08-010760"
  tag fix_id: "F-32968r567719_fix"
  tag cci: ["CCI-000366"]
  tag nist: ["CM-6 b"]
end
```

2. **Look for Key Words and Resources** - Dive more into what key words exist in the check text to determine what InSpec resources to use when writing the test. Most importantly, identify commands that are written in the check test like shown below. Find the _what_ of the command. For this control, `sudo` is not the _what_. `grep` is also not the _what_. `create_home` looks like an attribute of the `/etc/login.defs` file, which looks like the _what_! Look for a resource named `login_defs` in the [resource documentation](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/resources/).
```ruby
  desc "check", "Verify all local interactive users on RHEL 8 are assigned a home directory upon creation with 
the following command:

$ sudo grep -i create_home /etc/login.defs
...
```
<!-- ![Alt text](../../assets/img/check_text.png) -->
3. **Read the documentation** - Reference the syntax and examples to see if this resource is correct and how to use it.
[login defs resource page](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/resources/login_defs/)
![The `login_defs` Resource](../../assets/img/login_defs.png)
4. **Write the test!** - Reference the documentation to write the test. Here we add the describe block to the control below.

::: code-tabs#shell

@tab Describe Block
```ruby
  describe login_defs do
    its('CREATE_HOME') { should eq 'yes' }
  end
```
@tab Full Control
```ruby
control 'SV-230324' do
  title "All RHEL 8 local interactive user accounts must be assigned a home
directory upon creation."
  desc  "If local interactive users are not assigned a valid home directory,
there is no place for the storage and control of files they should own."
  desc  'rationale', ''
  desc  'check', "
    Verify all local interactive users on RHEL 8 are assigned a home directory
upon creation with the following command:
    $ sudo grep -i create_home /etc/login.defs
    CREATE_HOME yes
    If the value for \"CREATE_HOME\" parameter is not set to \"yes\", the line
is missing, or the line is commented out, this is a finding.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    Configure RHEL 8 to assign home directories to all new local interactive
users by setting the \"CREATE_HOME\" parameter in \"/etc/login.defs\" to
\"yes\" as follows.
    CREATE_HOME yes
  "
  impact 0.5
  tag severity: 'medium'
  tag gtitle: 'SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227'
  tag gid: 'V-230324'
  tag rid: 'SV-230324r627750_rule'
  tag stig_id: 'RHEL-08-010760'
  tag fix_id: 'F-32968r567719_fix'
  tag cci: ['CCI-000366']
  tag nist: ['CM-6 b']

  describe login_defs do
    its('CREATE_HOME') { should eq 'yes' }
  end
end
```

:::info Remember the matchers
Here, the login_defs resource shows examples using the `includes` and `eq` matcher. Here, we use `eq` because we are looking for only one result from the command, not an array of items.
::: 

5. **Run the test!**  
```bash
inspec exec rhel8-baseline-stubs -t docker://redhat8
```

6. **Troubleshoot errors** - If you have syntax errors or unexpected results, it's time to troubleshoot. The best first step in troubleshooting is to read the error message from the command line.

### Controls We Will Demonstrate  

| Control | Resource Used |
| --- | --- |
| SV-230324 | login_defs resource |
| SV-230250 | directory resource |
| SV-230243 | directory looping & file resource |
| SV-230505 | non applicable use case & package resource |

### Suggested Level 1 Controls  

| Control | Resource Used |
| --- | --- |
| SV-230383 | login_defs resource |
| SV-230249 | directory resource |
| SV-230471 | directory looping & file resource |
| SV-230241 | non applicable use case & package resource |

### Suggested Level 2 Controls  

| Control | Resource Used |
| --- | --- |
| SV-230281 | parse config file |
| SV-230365 | login_defs resource |
| SV-230264 | file content |

:::info Strings
Single quotes are dumb strings. Double quotes are smart strings. Smart strings means they allow [interpolation](http://ruby-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org/bonus/string_interpolation.html).

## Completed RHEL8 Profile for Reference

Below is the url to the completed RHEL8 Inspec Profile for reference, and a few things to take note of.

1. [redhat-enterprise-linux-8-stig-baseline](https://github.com/mitre/redhat-enterprise-linux-8-stig-baseline)

::: tip Key Elements in this Profile

- The use of `impact 0` for NA & Container Aware Controls
- How we make the controls `container aware`, and
- The `fail fast` approach to testing execution.

::: warning Wait, does this mean that I can cheat on all of these exercises by looking up all the real controls?!
Yes. Feel free. We suggest you at least try thinking through how you'd write this test code without the real baseline, though.
