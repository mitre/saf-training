### Convert the STIG XCCDF Benchmark To an InSpec Stubs Profile

::: note Timesaver Ahead!

We already converted the XCCDF STIG Benchmark into a starter profile using the `saf generate xccdf2inspec_stub` command using the correct flags, mapping file and other options.
:::

The SAF CLI has the `generate xccdf2inspec_stub` sub-command which can help you quickly convert an XCCDF Benchmark document into the start of an InSpec Profile.

```shell
XCCDF to InSpec Stub
generate xccdf2inspec_stub              Generate an InSpec profile stub from a DISA STIG XCCDF XML file

  USAGE
    $ saf generate xccdf2inspec_stub -i, --input=XML -o, --output=FOLDER

  OPTIONS
    -S, --useStigID              Use STIG IDs (<Group/Rule/Version>) instead of Group IDs (ex. 'V-XXXXX') for InSpec Control IDs
    -i, --input=input            (required) Path to the DISA STIG XCCDF file
    -l, --lineLength=lineLength  [default: 80] Characters between lines within InSpec controls
    -e, --encodingHeader         Add the "# encoding: UTF-8" comment at the top of each control
    -m, --metadata=metadata      Path to a JSON file with additional metadata for the inspec.yml file
    -o, --output=output          (required) [default: profile]
    -r, --useVulnerabilityId     Use Vulnerability IDs (ex. 'SV-XXXXX') instead of Group IDs (ex. 'V-XXXXX') for InSpec control IDs
    -s, --singleFile             Output the resulting controls as a single file
```

To learn how you can use the `saf generate xccdf2stub`, go to the saf-cli homepage which has all the options and capabilities as well as all the other utilities provided by the saf-cli, at <https://saf-cli.mitre.org/#generate>.

### Example 'Stub' Control SV-230502

Let's take a look at what one of the `stubs` created by the `saf-cli generate xccdf2stub` command:

```ruby
control 'SV-230502' do
  title 'The RHEL 8 file system automounter must be disabled unless required.'
  desc  "Automatically mounting file systems permits easy introduction of
unknown devices, thereby facilitating malicious activity."
  desc  'rationale', ''
  desc  'check', "
    Verify the operating system disables the ability to automount devices.

    Check to see if automounter service is active with the following command:

    Note: If the autofs service is not installed, this requirement is not
applicable.

    $ sudo systemctl status autofs

    autofs.service - Automounts filesystems on demand
    Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/autofs.service; disabled)
    Active: inactive (dead)

    If the \"autofs\" status is set to \"active\" and is not documented with
the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement,
this is a finding.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    Configure the operating system to disable the ability to automount devices.

    Turn off the automount service with the following commands:

    $ sudo systemctl stop autofs
    $ sudo systemctl disable autofs

    If \"autofs\" is required for Network File System (NFS), it must be
documented with the ISSO.

end
```

### Completed SV-230502 Control

Let's take a look at how we would write the InSpec control for SV-230502:

```ruby
control 'SV-230502' do
  title 'The RHEL 8 file system automounter must be disabled unless required.'
  desc  "Automatically mounting file systems permits easy introduction of
unknown devices, thereby facilitating malicious activity."
  desc  'rationale', ''
  desc  'check', "
    Verify the operating system disables the ability to automount devices.

    Check to see if automounter service is active with the following command:

    Note: If the autofs service is not installed, this requirement is not
applicable.

    $ sudo systemctl status autofs

    autofs.service - Automounts filesystems on demand
    Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/autofs.service; disabled)
    Active: inactive (dead)

    If the \"autofs\" status is set to \"active\" and is not documented with
the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement,
this is a finding.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    Configure the operating system to disable the ability to automount devices.

    Turn off the automount service with the following commands:

    $ sudo systemctl stop autofs
    $ sudo systemctl disable autofs

    If \"autofs\" is required for Network File System (NFS), it must be
documented with the ISSO.

  if virtualization.system.eql?('docker')
    impact 0.0
    describe "Control not applicable within a container" do
      skip "Control not applicable within a container"
    end
  else
    if package('autofs').installed?
      describe systemd_service('autofs.service') do
        it { should_not be_running }
        it { should_not be_enabled }
        it { should_not be_installed }
      end
    else
      impact 0.0
      describe 'The autofs service is not installed' do
        skip 'The autofs service is not installed, this control is Not Applicable.'
      end
    end
  end
end

### Completed RHEL8 Profile for Reference

Below is the url to the completed RHEL8 Inspec Profile for reference, and a few things to take note of.

1. [redhat-enterprise-linux-8-stig-baseline](https://github.com/CMSgov/redhat-enterprise-linux-8-stig-baseline)

::: tip Key Elements in this Profile

- The use of `impact 0` for NA & Container Aware Controls
- How we make the controls `container aware`, and
- The `fail fast` approach to testing execution.
