## Exploring the InSpec Shell

Before we test our NGINX configuration, let's plan which resources and matchers we'll need.

When writing InSpec code, many resources are available to you.

- You can [explore the InSpec documentation](https://www.inspec.io/docs/) to see which resources and matchers are available.
- You can [examine the source code](https://github.com/inspec/inspec) to see what's available. For example, you can see how file and other InSpec resources are implemented.
- You can also use examples, such as profiles provided on [Chef Supermarket](https://supermarket.chef.io/tools-directory), as a guide.

There's also [InSpec shell](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/shell/), which enables you to explore InSpec interactively. In this part, you'll use the InSpec shell to discover which resources you can use to test your NGINX configuration.

You're not required to use InSpec shell to develop your profiles. Some users find the InSpec shell to be a useful way to get immediate feedback and explore what's available. You can also use InSpec shell to debug your profiles.

### Entering the InSpec shell

Run `inspec shell` to enter the interactive session.

```sh
inspec shell
```
Which should drop you into the shell, like this:
```
Welcome to the interactive InSpec Shell
To find out how to use it, type: help

You are currently running on:

    Name:      ubuntu
    Families:  debian, linux, unix
    Release:   16.04
    Arch:      x86_64
```

Run `help` to see what commands are available.
```sh
help
```

Which should return something like:

```sh

inspec> help
    You are currently running on:

        Name:      ubuntu
        Families:  debian, linux, unix
        Release:   16.04
        Arch:      x86_64

    Available commands:

        `[resource]` - run resource on target machine
        `help resources` - show all available resources that can be used as commands
        `help [resource]` - information about a specific resource
        `help matchers` - show information about common matchers
        `exit` - exit the InSpec shell

    You can use resources in this environment to test the target machine.
```

Run `help resources` to see which resources are available.
```sh
help resources
```
Which will return a list like:
```sh
inspec> help resources

         - aide_conf
         - apache
         - apache_conf
         - apt
         - audit_policy
         - auditd
         - auditd_conf
         ...
         - file
         ...
         - xml
         - yaml
         - yum
         - yumrepo
```

You see `file` and other resources listed.

### Exploring the `file` resource

Earlier, we saw this `describe` block:

```ruby
describe file('/tmp') do
  it { should be_directory }
end
```

Let's run a few commands from the InSpec shell to see how the `file` resource functions.

::: tip What is the difference between InSpec and Ruby?
Inspec is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) on top of Ruby. In other words, InSpec is built on the Ruby programming language. For example, InSpec matchers are implemented as Ruby methods. 
:::

Run this command to list which methods are available to the `file` resource.

```ruby
file('/tmp').class.superclass.instance_methods(false).sort
```

Which will give you the following output:

```ruby
inspec> file('/tmp').class.superclass.instance_methods(false).sort

        => [:allowed?,
         :basename,
         :block_device?,
         :character_device?,
         :contain,
         :content,
         :directory?,
         ...
         :sticky,
         :sticky?,
         :suid,
         :symlink?,
         :to_s,
         :type,
         :uid,
         :version?,
         :writable?]
```

You can use the arrow or Page Up and Page Down keys to scroll through the list. When you're done, press `Q`.

::: tip What is the InSpec Shell?
InSpec shell is based on a tool called `pry`. `pry` is an interactive debugging environment for ruby and is one of the ruby developer's weapons against bugs.
:::

Let's use the InSpec shell to explore some resources in InSpec. We will start with one of the most common elements on the system: a directory.

In the InSpec Shell call the `file.directory?` method.

```sh
file('/tmp').directory?
```

This will return `true`, since `/tmp` is a directory on the system.

```sh
inspec> file('/tmp').directory?
        => true
```

You can see that the `/tmp` directory exists on your workstation container.

To make the tests easier to read, the InSpec language uses "syntactic sugar" to turn methods into English-like phrases. For example, the Ruby language contains boolean methods ending in `?` which evaluate to `true` or `false` (`nil` is a type of false). InSpec changes the syntax of these methods to include `be_` before the method rather than `?` after the method to make it more readable. For example, to check if a directory exists, Ruby would traditionally use `directory?` while InSpec uses `be_directory`.

::: info Using Ruby Predicate Methods

Given what we have just learned, the **best practice** in InSpec is to return something that evaluates to `true` or `false`.
The `?` (or `be_` in InSpec) makes your method a Ruby Predicate Method. See [Ruby predicate methods](http://ruby-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org/objects/predicates.html) to learn more.

:::

The InSpec shell understands the structure of blocks. This enables you to run mutiline code. As an example, run the entire `describe` block like this.

```ruby
describe file('/tmp') do
  it { should be_directory }
end
```

Which will run the entire block of code in the InSpec Shell and return the result.

```ruby
inspec> describe file('/tmp') do
inspec>  it { should be_directory }
inspec> end

Profile: inspec-shell
Version: (not specified)

File /tmp
  ✔  should be directory

Test Summary: 1 successful, 0 failures, 0 skipped
```

In practice, you don't typically run controls interactively this way for day to day use, but it is a great way to test out your ideas, find bugs or validate your approach before running a scan in its entirety on a target of evaluation.

### Explore The nginx Resource

Now's a good time to define the requirements for our NGINX configuration. Let's say that you require:

```sh
1. NGINX version 1.10.3 or later.
2. The following NGINX modules should be installed:
   * `http_ssl`
   * `stream_ssl`
   * `mail_ssl`
3. The NGINX configuration file - `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`- should:
   * be owned by the `root` user and group.
   * not be readable, writeable, or executable by others.

```

Let's see what resources are available to help define these requirements as InSpec controls.

Run `help resources` a second time. 

```sh
help resources
```

Notice InSpec provides two built-in resources to support NGINX – `nginx` and `nginx_conf`.

```sh
inspec> help resources

         - aide_conf
         - apache
         - apache_conf
         - apt
         ...
         - nginx
         - nginx_conf
         ...
         - xml
         - yaml
         - yum
         - yumrepo
         - zfs_dataset
         - zfs_pool
```

Run `nginx.methods`.

```ruby
nginx.methods
```

You can see the `version` and `modules` methods. 

You will use these methods to define the first two requirements.

```ruby
inspec> nginx.class.superclass.instance_methods(false).sort

        => [:bin_dir,
         :compiler_info,
         :error_log_path,
         :http_client_body_temp_path,
         :http_fastcgi_temp_path,
         :http_log_path,
         :http_proxy_temp_path,
         :http_scgi_temp_path,
         :http_uwsgi_temp_path,
         :lock_path,
         :modules,
         :modules_path,
         :openssl_version,
         ...
         :to_s,
         :version]
```

Run `nginx.version` to see what result you get.

```ruby
nginx.version
```

::: warning Expected Error Ahead 

Recall that you're working on your workstation  environment, which does not have NGINX installed. 

:::

```ruby
inspec> nginx.version

        NoMethodError: undefined method `[]' for nil:NilClass
        from /opt/inspec/embedded/lib/ruby/gems/2.4.0/gems/inspec-2.0.17/lib/resources/nginx.rb:39:in `block (2 levels) in <class:Nginx>'
```

We can verify this with Inspec by running the following command:

```ruby
package('nginx').installed?
```

As you can see we get `false` - since nginx is not installed on your `runner`.

```ruby
inspec> package('nginx').installed?

        => false
```

Now that we have explored and discovered the resource methods we need – `version` and `modules` – let's run InSpec shell commands against the target that does have NGINX installed to see what results we find. 

To do so, first start by exiting your InSpec shell session.

```
inspec> exit
```

Run `inspec shell` a second time and this time, provide the `-t` argument to connect the shell session to the target container.

First let's find our nginx container id using the `docker ps` command:

```shell
docker ps
```

Which will return something like:

```sh
➜  course git:(master) ✗ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                NAMES
d4bcef5bb9e3   nginx:latest   "/docker-entrypoint.…"   23 seconds ago   Up 22 seconds   80/tcp               nifty_shtern
4f0ceb9b5974   nginx:latest   "/docker-entrypoint.…"   2 months ago     Up 45 seconds   0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp   nginx
```

We can then use the container id of our nginx container to target the inspec shell at that container.

```sh
inspec shell -t docker://CONTAINER_ID
```

InSpec will then return at the Shell Prompt as before but this time we see we are on our container.

```sh
Welcome to the interactive InSpec Shell
To find out how to use it, type: help

You are currently running on:

    Name:      debian
    Families:  debian, linux, unix, os
    Release:   11.2
    Arch:      aarch64

inspec> 
```

Remember that the target does not have InSpec installed on it. Your shell session exists on the workstation; InSpec routes commands to the target instance over Docker.

Run the `package` resource a second time, this time on the target container.

```ruby
package('nginx').installed?'
```

As you can see, how the InSpec `package` resources returns `true`.

```
inspec> package('nginx').installed?

        => true
```

Now, let's get the `version` of NGINX that is installed on the target, run: `nginx.version`

```ruby
nginx.version
```

You can see that version 1.10.3 was installed on our container.

```
inspec> nginx.version

        => "1.10.3"
```

To complete the example, let's see which `modules` are enabled on the nginx container. Run `nginx.modules` to list the installed NGINX modules.

```ruby
nginx.modules
```

You see below - and hopefully on the data you got back on your container - that the required modules, `http_ssl`, `stream_ssl`, and `mail_ssl`, are installed.

```ruby
inspec> nginx.modules

        => ["http_ssl",
         "http_stub_status",
         "http_realip",
         "http_auth_request",
         "http_addition",
         "http_dav",
         "http_geoip",
         "http_gunzip",
         "http_gzip_static",
         "http_image_filter",
         "http_v2",
         "http_sub",
         "http_xslt",
         "stream_ssl",
         "mail_ssl"]
```

The [nginx_conf](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/resources/nginx_conf/) resource examines the contents of the NGINX configuration file, `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`.

Recall that the third requirement is to check whether the NGINX configuration file is owned by `root` and is not readable, writeable, or executable by others. Because we want to test attributes of the file itself, and not its contents, you'll use the `file` resource.

You saw earlier how the `file` resource provides the `readable`, `writeable`, and `executable` methods. You would also see that the `file` resource provides the `owned_by` and `grouped_into` methods.

```ruby
inspec> file('/tmp').class.superclass.instance_methods(false).sort

        => [:allowed?,
         :directory?,
         :executable?,
         :exist?,
         :file,
         :file?,
         :file_version,
         :gid,
         :group,
         :grouped_into?,
         ...
         :owned_by?,
         ...
         :readable?,
         ...
         :to_s,
         :type,
         :uid,
         :version?,
         :writable?]
```

These 5 `file` methods – `grouped_into`, `executable`, `owned_by`, `readable` and `writeable` – provide everything we need for the third requirement.

Exit the InSpec shell session with the `exit` command.

```sh
inspec> exit
```
