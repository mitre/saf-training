## 3.1 STIG Development Overview
To understand why Vulcan was desired it will be helpful to first provide a summary of how STIG development takes place in it's absence. Traditionally STIG development can be broken down into five high level categories: Submission -> Planning -> Development -> Validation -> Review and Approval. We'll provide a quick overview of each and the challenges that may arise.

### 3.1.1 Submission
Submission is very straight forward, first a need is identified for a STIG to exist. Once that is established then the question is who will develop it? If it's a vendor then they must submit a letter of intent to DISA which includes identifying a government sponsor, detailing the existing need within the DOD, and then submitting that to DISA.

If it will be an DISA driven project then it's just a matter of resourcing and prioritization of the work itself.

### 3.1.2 Planning
Planning typically would be an introductory meeting between the parties involved. Possibly also discussing resourcing and logistics to determine when/if those items are available to begin development.

### 3.1.3 Development
Development is where the fun begins and the bulk of the work for the STIG developer takes place.
