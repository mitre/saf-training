## 8. Run InSpec - NGINX Example



### 8.1. Example running an InSpec profile directly from Github

In this module, we use NGINX for learning purposes. If you're interested in NGINX specifically, you may be interested in the [MITRE nginx-stigready-baseline](https://github.com/mitre/nginx-stigready-baseline) profile on GitHub. 

::: details Alternative profiles
Alternatively, you may also check out the [DevSec Nginx Baseline](https://supermarket.chef.io/tools/nginx-baseline) profile on Chef Supermarket.

To execute the Chef Supermarket profile on your target system, run this `inspec supermarket exec` command.

Sometimes, there are multiple profiles available for the same software component. This could be because there are different people or teams who both wrote automation content, or it could be because one profile is based on one set of guidance (such as a DISA STIG) and another profile could be based on different guidance (such as a CIS Benchmark). 

If you see multiple profiles available and are unsure what to use, read the READMEs in each to see what guidance they are based on to understand what is most useful for your situation. You can also run mutliple profiles and compare the results to see which is more informative for your assessment. Lastly, you can always reach out to saf@groups.mitre.org if you have more questions.
:::

### 8.2 Forming the InSpec Command
- Since we are using the profile from GitHub, we will use the GitHub link `https://github.com/mitre/nginx-stigready-baseline` to specify the profile. 
- Because we are using a Docker container that is running in our lab environment, we can specify the target as `-t docker://nginx`. 
- We can chose to output the results to the command line and to a file like this `--reporter cli json:./results/nginx_vanilla_results.json`
- We can add the inputs file that we created so the profile is tailored to our environment like this `--input-file inputs.yml`

To execute this command to run the GitHub profile on your target system, run this `inspec exec` command.

```sh
inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/nginx-stigready-baseline -t docker://nginx --input-file inputs.yml --reporter cli json:./results/nginx_vanilla_results.json
```

### 8.3 Run the Command
Enter the command from the previous step in your terminal and press enter. It will take a moment to start running. 

#### 8.3.1 CLI (Command Line) Results
You should see output similar to that below. The whole profile should execute in only a couple minutes.
```sh
inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/nginx-stigready-baseline -t docker://nginx --input-file inputs.yml --reporter cli json:./results/nginx_vanilla_results.json

```

You see that many of the tests pass, while others fail and may require investigation.

<!-- You may want to extend the `nginx-baseline` with your own custom requirements. To do that, you might use what's called a _wrapper profile_. You can check out [Create a custom InSpec profile](https://learn.chef.io/modules/create-a-custom-profile#/) for a more complete example. -->


#### 8.3.2 Results saved to a file
You should also see your results in a JSON file located in `/results` folder with the name that you specified in the command, for example `nginx_vanilla_results.json`. If you are using the lab environment GitHub codespaces, you should see it on the top left of your screen under files. Right click that file and click "Download" so that you have this file locally for the next steps.

::: details More on --reporter Options
#### Different --reporter Options
InSpec allows you to output your test results to one or more reporters. You can configure the reporter(s) using either the --json-config option or the --reporter option. While you can configure multiple reporters to write to different files, only one reporter can output to the screen(stdout).

```
$ inspec exec /root/my_nginx -t ssh://TARGET_USERNAME:TARGET_PASSWORD@TARGET_IP --reporter cli json:baseline_output.json
```

#### Syntax

You can specify one or more reporters using the --reporter cli flag. You can also specify a output by appending a path separated by a colon.

Output json to screen.

```
inspec exec /root/my_nginx --reporter json
or
inspec exec /root/my_nginx --reporter json:-
```

Output yaml to screen

```
inspec exec /root/my_nginx --reporter yaml
or
inspec exec /root/my_nginx --reporter yaml:-
```

Output cli to screen and write json to a file.

`inspec exec /root/my_nginx --reporter cli json:/tmp/output.json`

Output nothing to screen and write junit and html to a file.

`inspec exec /root/my_nginx --reporter junit:/tmp/junit.xml html:www/index.html`

Output json to screen and write to a file. Write junit to a file.

`inspec exec /root/my_nginx --reporter json junit:/tmp/junit.xml | tee out.json`

If you wish to pass the profiles directly after specifying the reporters you will need to use the end of options flag --.

`inspec exec --reporter json junit:/tmp/junit.xml -- profile1 profile2`

Output cli to screen and write json to a file.

```json
{
  "reporter": {
    "cli": {
      "stdout": true
    },
    "json": {
      "file": "/tmp/output.json",
      "stdout": false
    }
  }
}
```

#### Supported Reporters

The following are the current supported reporters:

- cli
- json
- json-min
- yaml
- documentation
- junit
- progress
- json-rspec
- html

You can read more about [InSpec Reporters](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/reporters/) on the documentation page.
