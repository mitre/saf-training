## InSpec Commands and Documentation

Before we test our NGINX configuration, let's take a look at the InSpec commands and documentation we can use to write tests.

### How to Run InSpec

Use the InSpec executable with the command `inspec exec` to run a profile against a system. The generic command is below, but take a look at our breakdown on [How To Run InSpec](https://mitre.github.io/saf-training/courses/user/06.html) for the MITRE SAF User course for more information.

```sh
inspec exec WHERE_IS_THE_PROFILE -t WHAT_IS_THE_TARGET --more-flags EXTRA_STUFF --reporter WHAT_SHOULD_INSPEC_DO_WITH_THE_RESULTS
```

::: details Want to try it out?
You can run a sample InSpec command against the nginx target running in the development lab environment using your `my_nginx` profile. Remember, this profile only has one sample control right now.

::: code-tabs#shell

@tab Run InSpec
```bash
inspec exec my_nginx -t docker://nginx --reporter cli
```
@tab Expected Output
```bash
Profile:   InSpec Profile (my_nginx)
Version:   0.1.0
Target:    docker://31e4ea1be052a9bcc137003e77cbc7f0a4a3149576a2ce65354092424b0d3a89
Target ID: 761efa53-ee0a-5ea0-a459-b2a5d287b531

  ✔  tmp-1.0: Create /tmp directory
     ✔  File /tmp is expected to be directory

  File /tmp
     ✔  is expected to be directory

Profile Summary: 1 successful control, 0 control failures, 0 controls skipped
Test Summary: 2 successful, 0 failures, 0 skipped
```

### How to Write InSpec 

The `inspec exec` command is used to run or _execute_ InSpec profiles. Now, let's talk about InSpec's existing documentation and features to support _writing_ those InSpec profiles.

Good InSpec tests will use resources, many of which are already built in, to easily describe some part of the system. Remember the `file` resource as an example from the previous section. Additionally, tests should use matchers to implement the logic check of an expected result. The previous example used `be_directory` as a matcher. There are a number of built-in [matchers](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/matchers/): `be_in`, `be_readable`, `cmp`, `include`, to list a few.

:::tip Make Writing InSpec Easier with Built-in Resources
InSpec features dozens of resources and matchers that come predefined in the language. These resources are a core benefit to using InSpec because they allow you to leverage existing stable code to write simple and consistent tests.

When writing profiles, refer back to the documentation for resources. They often give you an example of how to write a test that matches your current problem.
:::

:::info Finding Documentation
- Explore the [InSpec documentation](https://www.inspec.io/docs/) to see which resources and matchers are available, including descriptions of their attributes and examples of their use.
- Examine the [source code](https://github.com/inspec/inspec) to see what's available. For example, you can see how `file` and other InSpec resources are implemented.
- Reference examples, such as profiles provided on [Chef Supermarket](https://supermarket.chef.io/tools-directory), as a guide.
- Explore InSpec interactively using the [InSpec shell](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/shell/).
:::

### The InSpec shell

The [InSpec shell](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/shell/) enables you to explore InSpec interactively. In this part, you'll use the InSpec shell to discover which resources can be used to test your NGINX configuration.

You are not required to use the InSpec shell to develop your profiles, but some users (including this course's instructors) find the InSpec shell to be a useful way to get immediate feedback and explore what's available. You can also use the InSpec shell to debug your tests; the shell lets you write and execute `describe` blocks in-line.

::: details What is the InSpec Shell?
InSpec shell is based on a tool called `pry`. [`pry`](https://github.com/pry/pry) is an interactive debugging environment for Ruby.
:::

### Entering the InSpec shell

Run `inspec shell` to enter the interactive session.

::: code-tabs#shell

@tab InSpec Shell Command

```sh
inspec shell
```
@tab Output - Enter the InSpec Shell
```sh
Welcome to the interactive InSpec Shell
To find out how to use it, type: help

You are currently running on:

    Name:      ubuntu
    Families:  debian, linux, unix, os
    Release:   20.04
    Arch:      x86_64
```
:::

Run `help` to see what commands are available.

::: code-tabs#shell

@tab Command - help
```sh
help
```

@tab Output - help
```sh
inspec> help
You are currently running on:

    Name:      ubuntu
    Families:  debian, linux, unix, os
    Release:   20.04
    Arch:      x86_64

Available commands:

    `[resource]` - run resource on target machine
    `help resources` - show all available resources that can be used as commands
    `help [resource]` - information about a specific resource
    `help matchers` - show information about common matchers
    `exit` - exit the InSpec shell

You can use resources in this environment to test the target machine. For example:

    command('uname -a').stdout
    file('/proc/cpuinfo').content => "value"
```
:::

Run `help resources` to see which resources are available.

::: code-tabs#shell

@tab Command
```sh
help resources
```
@tab Output
```sh
inspec> help resources

         - aide_conf
         - apache
         - apache_conf
         - apt
         - audit_policy
         - auditd
         - auditd_conf
         ...
         - file
         ...
        - xml
        - yaml
        - yum
        - zfs_dataset
        - zfs_pool
```
:::

You see `file` and other resources listed.

### Using the InSpec Shell

Earlier, we saw this `describe` block:

```ruby
describe file('/tmp') do
  it { should be_directory }
end
```

The InSpec shell understands the structure of blocks. This enables you to run mutiline code. As an example, run the entire `describe` block like this which will run the entire block of code in the InSpec Shell and return the result.

::: code-tabs#shell

@tab Command - describe block
```ruby
describe file('/tmp') do
  it { should be_directory }
end
```

@tab Output - describe block
```ruby
inspec> describe file('/tmp') do
inspec>   it { should be_directory }  
inspec> end  

Profile:   inspec-shell
Version:   (not specified)
Target ID: 

  File /tmp
     ✔  is expected to be directory

Test Summary: 1 successful, 0 failures, 0 skipped
```
:::

In practice, you don't typically run controls interactively this way for day to day use, but it is a great way to test out your ideas, find bugs or validate your approach before running a scan in its entirety on a target of evaluation.

:::tip What is the difference between InSpec and Ruby?
Inspec is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) on top of Ruby. In other words, InSpec is built on the Ruby programming language. For example, InSpec matchers are implemented as Ruby methods. 
:::

### Exploring Resources 
#### `file` example
You can also use the InSpec shell to explore resources, in addition to referencing the [resource documentation](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/resources/). Here, we can use the InSpec shell to see how the `file` resource functions.
Run this command to list which methods are available to the `file` resource.

::: code-tabs#shell

@tab Command - file resource
```ruby
file('/tmp').class.superclass.instance_methods(false).sort
```

@tab Output - file resource

```ruby
inspec> file('/tmp').class.superclass.instance_methods(false).sort

        => [:allowed?,
         :basename,
         :block_device?,
         :character_device?,
         :contain,
         :content,
         :directory?,
         ...
         :sticky,
         :sticky?,
         :suid,
         :symlink?,
         :to_s,
         :type,
         :uid,
         :version?,
         :writable?]
```
:::

You can use the arrow or Page Up and Page Down keys to scroll through the list. When you're done, press `Q`.

::: details Exploring Resources in the InSpec Shell
Let's use the InSpec shell to explore some resources in InSpec. We will start with one of the most common elements on the system: a directory. In the InSpec Shell call the `file.directory?` method.


```sh
file('/tmp').directory?
```

```sh
inspec> file('/tmp').directory?
        => true
```

This will return `true`, since `/tmp` is a directory on the system and exists on your workstation container.

To make the tests easier to read, the InSpec language uses "syntactic sugar" to turn methods into English-like phrases. For example, the Ruby language contains boolean methods ending in `?` which evaluate to `true` or `false` (`nil` is a type of false). InSpec changes the syntax of these methods to include `be_` before the method rather than `?` after the method to make it more readable. For example, to check if a directory exists, Ruby would traditionally use `directory?` while InSpec uses `be_directory`.

::: info Using Ruby Predicate Methods

Given what we have just learned, the **best practice** in InSpec is to return something that evaluates to `true` or `false`.
The `?` (or `be_` in InSpec) makes your method a Ruby Predicate Method. See [Ruby predicate methods](http://ruby-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org/objects/predicates.html) to learn more.

:::

#### `nginx` example

Now's a good time to define the requirements for our NGINX configuration. Let's say that you require:

```sh
1. NGINX version 1.10.3 or later.
2. The following NGINX modules should be installed:
   * `http_ssl`
   * `stream_ssl`
   * `mail_ssl`
3. The NGINX configuration file - `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`- should exist as a file.
4. The NGINX configuration file should:
   * be owned by the `root` user and group.
   * not be readable, writeable, or executable by others.
5. The NGINX shell access should be restricted to admin users.
```

In the next section, we will start writing controls for `my_nginx` profile. 

Let's see what resources are available for `nginx`.

Run `help resources` a second time to identify InSpec's provided two built-in resources to support NGINX – `nginx` and `nginx_conf`.

::: code-tabs#shell

@tab Command - resources
```sh
help resources
```
@tab Output - resources
```sh
inspec> help resources

         - aide_conf
         - apache
         - apache_conf
         - apt
         ...
         - nginx
         - nginx_conf
         ...
         - xml
         - yaml
         - yum
         - yumrepo
         - zfs_dataset
         - zfs_pool
```
:::

Run `nginx.methods`. This will list all of the available methods for the `nginx` resource. You can see the `version` and `modules` methods. These will be useful to us in the next section.

::: code-tabs#shell

@tab Command - nginx methods
```ruby
nginx.methods
```

@tab Output - nginx methods
```ruby
=> [:params,
 :bin_dir,
 :prefix,
 :openssl_version,
 :compiler_info,
 :support_info,
 ...
 :http_scgi_temp_path,
 :version,
 :resource_id,
 :to_s,
 :service,
 ...
  :equal?,
 :__id__,
 :instance_eval,
 :instance_exec]
```
:::

Run `nginx.version` to see what result you get.

::: warning Expected Error Ahead 

Recall that you're working on your workstation  environment, which does not have NGINX installed. 

:::

::: code-tabs#shell

@tab Command - nginx version
```ruby
nginx.version
```

@tab Output - nginx version
```ruby
inspec> nginx.version
NoMethodError: undefined method `[]' for nil:NilClass
from /opt/inspec/embedded/lib/ruby/gems/2.4.0/gems/inspec-2.0.17/lib/resources/nginx.rb:39:in `block (2 levels) in <class:Nginx>'
```
:::

We can verify this with Inspec by running the following command:

::: code-tabs#shell

@tab Command - nginx installed
```ruby
package('nginx').installed?
```
@tab Output - nginx installed
```ruby
inspec> package('nginx').installed?

        => false
```
:::
As you can see we get `false` - since nginx is not installed on your `runner`.

We can instead run InSpec shell commands against the **target that does have NGINX installed** to see what results we find. 

To do so, first start by exiting your InSpec shell session.

```
exit
```

Run `docker ps` to see the running docker containers in your development lab environment that we can test:

::: code-tabs#shell

@tab Command - docker
```shell
docker ps
```

@tab Output - docker

```sh
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                NAMES
d4bcef5bb9e3   nginx:latest   "/docker-entrypoint.…"   23 seconds ago   Up 22 seconds   80/tcp               nifty_shtern
4f0ceb9b5974   nginx:latest   "/docker-entrypoint.…"   2 months ago     Up 45 seconds   0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp   nginx
```
:::


We can enter the InSpec shell on the nginx container instead of our lab environment host machine that we did before.
Run `inspec shell`, this time providing the `-t` argument to connect the shell session to the target container.

::: code-tabs#shell

@tab Command - shell into container
```sh
inspec shell -t docker://nginx
```

@tab Alternate Command
```sh
inspec shell -t docker://CONTAINER_ID
```

@tab Output - shell into container
```sh
Welcome to the interactive InSpec Shell
To find out how to use it, type: help

You are currently running on:

    Name:      debian
    Families:  debian, linux, unix, os
    Release:   12.2
    Arch:      x86_64
```
:::

::: tip InSpec is agentless
Remember that the target does not have InSpec installed on it. Your shell session exists on the workstation; InSpec routes commands to the target instance over Docker.
:::

Check that the nginx package is intalled, this time on the target container.

::: code-tabs#shell

@tab Command - package installed
```ruby
package('nginx').installed?
```

@tab Output - package installed

```ruby
inspec> package('nginx').installed?

        => true
```
:::

Now, let's get the `version` of NGINX that is installed on the target, run: `nginx.version`. You can see that version 1.23.3 was installed on our container.

::: code-tabs#shell

@tab Command - version
```ruby
nginx.version
```

@tab Output - version
```
inspec> nginx.version
=> "1.25.3"
```
:::

To complete the example, let's see which `modules` are enabled on the nginx container. Run `nginx.modules` to list the installed NGINX modules.

::: code-tabs#shell

@tab Command - nginx modules
```ruby
nginx.modules
```

@tab Output - nginx modules
```ruby
=> ["http_addition",
 "http_auth_request",
 "http_dav",
 "http_flv",
 "http_gunzip",
 "http_gzip_static",
 "http_mp4",
 "http_random_index",
 "http_realip",
 "http_secure_link",
 "http_slice",
 "http_ssl",
 "http_stub_status",
 "http_sub",
 "http_v2",
 "mail_ssl",
 "stream_realip",
 "stream_ssl",
 "stream_ssl_preread"]
```
:::

::: details Looking at the nginx_conf resource
The [nginx_conf](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/resources/nginx_conf/) resource examines the contents of the NGINX configuration file, `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`.
:::
To check whether the NGINX configuration file exists as a file, we want to test attributes of the file itself, so we use the `file` resource.

Use the `file` resource to check whether the NGINX configuration file is owned by `root` and is not readable, writeable, or executable by others. You saw earlier how the `file` resource provides the `readable`, `writeable`, and `executable` methods. You would also see that the `file` resource provides the `owned_by` and `grouped_into` methods.


::: code-tabs

@tab Command - file methods
```sh
file('/tmp').class.superclass.instance_methods(false).sort
```

@tab Output - file methods
```sh
        => [:allowed?,
         :directory?,
         :executable?,
         :exist?,
         :file,
         :file?,
         :file_version,
         :gid,
         :group,
         :grouped_into?,
         ...
         :owned_by?,
         ...
         :readable?,
         ...
         :to_s,
         :type,
         :uid,
         :version?,
         :writable?]
```
:::

To check whether shell access has been provided to non-admin users, because we want to test attributes of users, you'll use the `users` resource.

::: code-tabs

@tab Command - users methods
```sh
users.class.superclass.instance_methods(false).sort
```

@tab Output - users methods
```sh
        => [:count, 
        :disabled, 
        :disabled?, 
        :enabled?, 
        :entries, 
        :exist?, 
        :exists?, 
        :gids, 
        :groupnames, 
        :groups, 
        :homes, 
        :maxdays,

        :uids, 
        :usernames, 
        :warndays, 
        :where]
```
:::

Exit the InSpec shell session with the `exit` command.

```sh
exit
```
