# Building, Development & Hacking

## Requirements

- Node v18.18+

## Running 

This project uses npm, is a Vuepress v2 and Vue3 project, and employs simple cypress tests for basic smoke testing. For debugging, setup issues, or questions about additional capabilities of the VuePress Theme, please refer to the documentation at the link above.

## Running in Dev

```shell
npm install
npm run docs:dev
```
## Building

```shell

```

## Running Cypress Tests

The Cypress tests are located in the ./cypress directory, adjacent to the ./src directory.

Additional Cypress commands can be found in the package.json file under the scripts section.

```

This command starts the headless Cypress server, builds the current version of the site, runs the site, and then executes the Cypress tests.
