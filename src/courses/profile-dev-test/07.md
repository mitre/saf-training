## Choosing Your Approach

This project follows the [GitFlow model](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow "GitFlow Announcement Blog") for managing the repository, accepting pull requests (PRs), and merging changes into the profile.

## Micro vs Massive Pull Requests (PRs)

In software development, the decision between making many small pull requests (micro PRs) or fewer, larger pull requests (massive PRs) often depends on the context. Both approaches have their benefits and challenges.

### Micro PRs

Micro PRs involve making frequent, small changes to the codebase. Each PR is focused on a single task or feature.

**Benefits:**

- **Easier to review:** Small changes are easier for reviewers to understand and provide feedback on.
- **Less risk:** If a problem arises, it's easier to identify and fix because the change is isolated.
- **Faster feedback loop:** Frequent PRs mean more opportunities for feedback and improvement.

**Challenges:**

- **Overhead:** Each PR requires its own review and merge process, which can be time-consuming.
- **Context switching:** Frequent changes can disrupt the flow of work, especially if developers have to switch between different tasks.

### Macro PRs

Macro PRs involve making larger, more comprehensive changes to the codebase. Each PR may encompass multiple tasks or features.

**Benefits:**

- **Efficiency:** Larger PRs can be more efficient because they require fewer reviews and merges.
- **Coherence:** By grouping related changes together, it may be easier to understand how different parts of the codebase interact.

**Challenges:**

- **Difficult to review:** Large changes can be overwhelming for reviewers, making it harder to catch issues.
- **Higher risk:** If a problem arises, it can be more difficult to identify and fix because it could be anywhere in the large set of changes.
- **Delayed feedback:** With fewer PRs, there are fewer opportunities for feedback.

### PR Strategies for Different Update Scenarios

The choice between micro and massive PRs can significantly impact the workflows in our `Patch Update`, `Release Update`, and `Major Version Update`.

- **Patch and Release Updates:** These updates typically involve minor changes or additions, which can be easily managed with either micro or massive PRs. The choice depends on your team's preference for review speed and context switching.
- **Major Version or Large Jump Release Updates:** These updates require a thorough review of every single control and requirement. They also necessitate extensive testing, both automated (via the CI/CD testing matrix) and manual. In this scenario, the overhead of managing multiple micro or mini PRs can be substantial. However, the benefit is that it allows for more granitary control and review of changes. It's also easier to isolate and fix issues that arise during testing.

In conclusion, the choice between micro and massive PRs depends on the specific needs and circumstances of your project. It's important to strike a balance that maximizes efficiency while minimizing risk, and fosters effective collaboration within your team.
