## AWS Testing Setup
>
> Note: This guide assumes basic familiarity with AWS. If you're new to AWS, please review the [AWS Getting Started Guide](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/) first.

1. Configure your AWS CLI and set up your AWS credentials
   - If you haven't installed AWS CLI, [download it here](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
   - Run `aws configure` to set up your credentials
2. Verify AWS CLI access: `aws s3 ls`
   - If this fails, check your credentials and permissions
3. Clone the repository
4. Navigate to the root directory of the profile repository
5. Configure Kitchen for AWS EC2:

   ```bash
   export KITCHEN_LOCAL_YAML=kitchen.ec2.yml
   ```

   > The kitchen-ec2 driver enables TestKitchen to create and manage AWS EC2 instances for testing

6. (Optional) Target a specific control:

   ```bash
   export INSPEC_CONTROL='SV-230222'
   ```

## Running Through the AWS Test Suite
>
> Understanding the Test Workflow:
>
> - **Vanilla**: Represents an unmodified baseline system
> - **Hardened**: Represents a system with security controls applied

7. List the kitchen instances with: `bundle exec kitchen list`. You should see something like this:

```shell
  Instance         Driver  Provisioner      Verifier  Transport  Last Action  Last Error
  vanilla-rhel-8   Ec2     AnsiblePlaybook  Inspec    Ssh        Verified     None
  hardened-rhel-8  Ec2     AnsiblePlaybook  Inspec    Ssh        Verified     None
```

### Key Testing Steps Explained

8. **Create** the test instance:

   ```bash
   bundle exec kitchen create vanilla
   ```

   > This step launches a fresh EC2 instance for testing

```shell
➜  redhat-enterprise-linux-8-stig-baseline git:(main*)bundle exec kitchen create vanilla
-----> Starting Test Kitchen (v3.5.1)
-----> Creating <vanilla-rhel-8>...
    < OTHER OUTPUT >
    Finished creating <vanilla-rhel-8> (0m0.00s).
-----> Test Kitchen is finished. (0m1.21s)
```

9. **Converge** the instance:

   ```bash
   bundle exec kitchen converge vanilla
   ```

   > Convergence applies the necessary configurations to prepare the system for testing

```shell
➜  redhat-enterprise-linux-8-stig-baseline git:(main*)bundle exec kitchen converge vanilla
-----> Starting Test Kitchen (v3.5.1)
      NOTICE - Installing needed packages
      Updating Subscription Management repositories.
      Unable to read consumer identity

      This system is not registered with an entitlement server. You can use subscription-manager to register.

      39 files removed
      < LOTS OF OTHER OUTPUT >
      Downloading files from <vanilla-rhel-8>
      Finished converging <vanilla-rhel-8> (0m21.36s).
-----> Test Kitchen is finished. (1m13.52s)
```

10. Run InSpec on the kitchen instance: `bundle exec kitchen verify`.

```shell
    ➜  redhat-enterprise-linux-8-stig-baseline git:(main*)bundle exec kitchen verify vanilla
  -----> Starting Test Kitchen (v3.5.1)
  -----> Setting up <vanilla-rhel-8>...
        Finished setting up <vanilla-rhel-8> (0m0.00s).
  -----> Verifying <vanilla-rhel-8>...

```

### Analyzing Results

- Results Location: `./spec/results/rhel-8_*`
- Use [Heimdall Lite](https://heimdall-lite.mitre.org) to compare results:
  1. Load both `hardened` and `vanilla` results
  2. Compare to verify expected failures and passes
  3. Review corner cases for complete coverage

::: tip Always remember to pause or destroy your test instances after testing to avoid unnecessary AWS charges:
>
> ```bash
> bundle exec kitchen destroy vanilla
> ```
>
> ```sh
> Pause your instance in the AWS Console
> ```
>
:::

1. Destroy the kitchen instance: `bundle exec kitchen destroy vanilla`.
2. For steps that apply to making updates, patches, and updates to the profile, see the next section, [Updating the Profile](#18-updating-the-profile).
3. Your InSpec scan results are located in the `./spec/results/` directory, named `./spec/results/rhel-8_*`.
4. Use [Heimdall Lite](https://heimdall-lite.mitre.org "MITRE Heimdall Lite") to load both the `hardened` and `vanilla` results to ensure your changes and updates, "failed as expected and passed as expected and covered your corner cases."
