## An Overview of the OHDF Schema

In order to make an OHDF mapper, it is important to understand the specifics of how OHDF is actually structured through the OHDF schema.

The OHDF schema is designed to provide a simple, structured, and hierarchal view of security tool results. OHDF actually consists of several related schema formats; however, the <i>Exec JSON</i> format is the most common and is typically the one being referred to when speaking of the OHDF schema. Any file or object that implements the schema can be broken down into a hierarchy of four main object structures. These structures are:

### 1. <i>**Exec JSON**</i>

This is the top level object structure that contains the security data (which is stored in the <i>Profiles</i> structure and related substructures), relevant metadata on the tool used to generate the OHDF file itself (stored in structures such as <i>Platform</i>, <i>Version</i>, and <i>Statistics</i>), and miscellaneous information that does not neatly fit in the previous structures (stored in the <i>Passthrough</i> structure).

Before we discuss the <i>Profiles</i> structure and its related substructures, here is a brief introduction to the latter object structures contained by the <i>Exec JSON</i> superstructure:

- <i>**Platform**</i>: This structure contains metadata involving the platform or tool that is producing the OHDF file.

- <i>**Version**</i>: This structure contains metadata involving the version of the platform or tool that is producing the OHDF file.

- <i>**Statistics**</i>: This structure contains metadata involving the specific statistics of the original run that produced the export.

- <i>**Passthrough**</i>: The primary purpose of the <i>Passthrough</i> structure is to contain and transport any piece of information that cannot be properly stored in the other <i>Exec JSON</i> substructures. Unlike other object structures in the OHDF schema, there is no formal schema declaration for the specific fields that exist in <i>Passthrough</i>. This means that <i>Passthrough</i> is fluid and capable of accommodating user-defined object fields as needed. There are, however, commonly agreed upon fields for specific capabilities, such as data preservation, that are discussed further in the next section.

A basic representation of this structure in JSON is as so:

```json
{
  execjson: {
    platform: {...},
    version: ...,
    statistics: {...},
    profiles: [...],
    passthrough: {...}
  }
}
```

### 2. <i>**Profiles**</i>

This structure contains metadata on the target system of the original security tool export and on the specific run performed by the security tool. Through this, the <i>Profiles</i> structure provides a high-level overview of the security tool result and the targeted system, which are formatted in a manner that is digestible and immediately accessible to the assessor. There is typically only one <i>Profiles</i> instance in a single <i>Exec JSON</i> structure (represented as a single element in an array of <i>Profiles</i>). Further instances of <i>Profiles</i> are additional overlays.

A basic representation of this structure in JSON is as so:

```json
{
  execjson: {
    profiles: [...],
    ...
  }
}
```

### 3. <i>**Controls**</i>

Controls are security requirements that are used to prevent, mitigate, and address various security risks to sensitive information, systems, and infrastructure. In the case of OHDF, the <i>Controls</i> structure is a collection of requirements tested for by an external security tool to ensure that the target complies with vulnerability and weakness prevention standards. Any given <i>Profiles</i> structure contains some number of <i>Controls</i> structures (i.e., an array of <i>Controls</i>) which were tested against the target system during the original security tool run.

A basic representation of this structure in JSON is as so:

```json
{
  profiles: [
    {
      controls: [...],
      ...
    },
    ...
  ],
  ...
}
```

### 4. <i>**Results**</i>

The <i>Results</i> structure contains information on the results of specific tests ran by the security tool on the target system against a single security requirement/control. These results will always correlate to a certain instance of a <i>Controls</i> structure and can report either `passed`, `failed`, `skipped`, or `error` to indicate the test status. Any given <i>Controls</i> structure contains some number of <i>Results</i> structures (i.e., an array of <i>Results</i>) which reflect the implemented tests to check if the target system is actually meeting the overall requirement/control. The test statuses of these results cumulatively influence the determined compliance level of the target system for some set of requirements/controls.

A basic representation of this structure in JSON is as so:

```json
{
  controls: [
    {
      results: [...],
      ...
    },
    ...
  ],
  ...
}
```

## Overall Hierarchy

These aforementioned main object structures cumulatively result in the following general structure:

```json
{
  execjson: {
    platform: {...},
    version: ...,
    statistics: {...},
    profiles: [
      {
        controls: [
          {
            results: [...],
            ...
          },
          ...
        ],
        ...
      },
      ...
    ],
    passthrough: {...}
  }
}
```

## A Look Back

In this section, we covered:

- [Core structures of the OHDF schema:](#an-overview-of-the-ohdf-schema)

  - Exec JSON

    - This is the top level object structure that acts as a container for all of the other object structures that are specialized for specific sets of information.

  - Profiles

    - This structure is for containing high-level metadata on the security tool run.

  - Controls

    - This structure is for containing information pertaining to the set of controls/requirements that were ran against the target system in the original security tool run.

  - Results

    - This structure is for containing information pertaining to the specific test results of the application of the control/requirement set against the target system.

### Knowledge Check

:::details Describe the relationship between <i>Profiles</i>, <i>Controls</i>, and <i>Results</i>.

The <i>Profiles</i> object structure contains one or more <i>Controls</i> structures (represented as a `controls` array within a `profiles` element).

The <i>Controls</i> object structure contains one or more <i>Results</i> structures (represented as a `results` array within a `controls` element).
:::

:::details Say that we map from Format A to OHDF and have data elements left over in Format A that are still uncorrelated. What do we do with those data elements?
We perform data preservation and place the uncorrelated data elements from Format A into the <i>Passthrough</i> structure in OHDF (the explicit field to use will be defined later).
:::

### Knowledge Review

Now that we're familiar with the general layout of an OHDF file, let's briefly look at an actual OHDF file generated from a Twistlock security scan export. This OHDF file in particular was created through the OHDF Converters library embedded in the Heimdall visualizer.

Since we have not yet gone over the specific OHDF schema fields, try to focus on the actual information being stored by file instead and ask yourself:

- What is the purpose of this specific piece of data? What is it trying to convey (file metadata, vulnerability alerts, check results, etc.)?

- Does this piece of data fit in with the general purpose of the structure that contains it?

- Would this piece of data fit better in another structure?
