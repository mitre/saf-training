## What is OHDF Converters?

OHDF Converters is a custom data normalization library which leverages OHDF mappers for transforming various security data formats to and from OHDF. It is currently integrated into [Heimdall2](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2) and the [SAF CLI](https://github.com/mitre/saf), which collectively are part of the [Security Automation Framework (SAF)](https://saf.mitre.org/#/), a set of tools and processes which aim to standardize and ease security compliance testing and verification within an automated build pipeline.
