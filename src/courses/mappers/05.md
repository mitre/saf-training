## An Overview of the OHDF Schema

In order to make an OHDF mapper, it is important to understand the specifics of how OHDF is actually structured through the OHDF schema.

The OHDF schema is designed to provide a simple, structured, and hierarchal view of security validation results. Any file or object that implements the schema can be broken down into a hierarchy of three structures. These structures are:

### 1. <i>**Profiles**</i>

This structure contains metadata on the scan target of the original security service export and on the run performed by the security tool. <i>Profiles</i> provide a high-level overview of the security service scan and the targeted system, which are formatted in a manner which is digestible and immediately accessible to the assessor.

### 2. <i>**Controls**</i>

Controls are security standards that are used to prevent, mitigate, and address various security risks to sensitive information and infrastructure. In the case of OHDF, the <i>controls</i> structure is a collection of controls tested for by an external security service to ensure that the target complies with vulnerability and weakness prevention standards. Any given <i>profile</i> contains any number of <i>controls</i> which were tested against the target system during the original security service analysis.

### 3. <i>**Results**</i>

The <i>results</i> structure contains information on the results of specific tests ran by the security service on the scan target against a security control. These results will always correlate to a certain control and will either report `passed` or `failed` to indicate the test status (other statuses exist but are rare) which cumulatively influence the determined compliance level of the scan target for some set of controls. Any given <i>control</i> contains any number of <i>results</i> which reflect the implemented tests to check if the target system is actually compliant with the control.

## Overall Hierarchy

These aforementioned structures cumulatively result in the following generalized structure:

```
// Data fields have been removed for the sake of demonstration
profiles: [
  0: {
    controls: [
      0: {
        results: [
          0: {
          },
          ...
        ]
      },
      ...
    ]
  },
  ...
]
```
