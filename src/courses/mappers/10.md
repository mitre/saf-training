## A Look Ahead

In this section, we will cover:

## Environment Set Up

Node.js (a runtime environment for JavaScript) and Yarn (a package manager for JavaScript/TypeScript) are external utilities which are utilized extensively within this guide. The following section details their installation process.

Linux/Mac OS:

1. Install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script).

- 1a. Use either of the following commands to install nvm:

  ```shell
  curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
  ```

  ```shell
  wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
  ```

- 1b. Either restart the terminal or run the following commands to use nvm:
  ```shell
  export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
  [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm
  ```

2. Run the following command to install and use Node.js v18:

```shell
nvm install 18
```

3. Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

Windows:

1. Install [Node.js v18 via the installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

2. Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install):

## Repository Set Up

1. Fork/branch a development repository from the main [Heimdall2 GitHub repository](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2).

   - SAF team developers have write access to the main repository and should [create a branch](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/managing-branches#creating-a-branch) on the primary development repository. Non-SAF team developers should instead [create a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) of the main repository and create a development branch there.

2. Create a draft [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request#creating-the-pull-request) for your development branch against the main repository branch.

3. Install the necessary dependencies for Heimdall2. Under the `heimdall2` directory, enter the following command in the terminal:

```shell
yarn install
```
