### Base Converter Tools <a name="base"></a>

[//] # WIP

The <i>base-converter</i> class is the underlying foundation which enables \*-to-HDF mapping in HDF Converters. It defines \*-to-HDF mappers and provides critical tools which allow for the construction of such mappers. All \*-to-HDF mappers inherit from this class and therefore have access to the tools that this class provides; <b>it is thus imperative that you utilize these tools to their fullest potential to ease and simplify mapper development</b>. The provided tools are as follows:

- <i>path</i>: Denote JSON object path to go to

  - Use:

  ```
  path: PATH_AS_STRING
  ```

  - Example:

  ```
  //Attribute 'id' will be set as whatever JSON object attribute 'vulnerability.id' is
  id: {path: 'vulnerability.id'}
  ```

- <i>transformer</i>: Execute given code sequence; operates similar to an anonymous function

  - Use:

  ```
  transformer: (PARAMETERS): OUTPUT_TYPE => {CODE_TO_EXECUTE}
  ```

  - Example:

  ```
  //Attribute 'code' will be set as the returned stringified JSON object of input 'vulnerability'
  code: {
    transformer: (vulnerability: Record<string, unknown>): string => {
      return JSON.stringify(vulnerability, null, 2);
    }
  }
  ```

- <i>arrayTransformer</i>: Execute given code sequence on a given array; primarily used when in an attribute that is an array of objects

  - Use:

  ```
  arrayTransformer: CODE_TO_EXECUTE
  ```

  - Example:

  ```
  //The function 'deduplicateId' will run against all items in the current array that the 'arrayTransformer' was called inside
  arrayTransformer: deduplicateId
  ```

- <i>pathTransform</i>:

  - Use:

  ```
  ```

  - Example:

  ```
  ```

- <i>key</i>: Used by Base Converter to sort the an array of objects by

  - Use:

  ```
  key: KEY_AS_STRING
  ```

  - Example:

  ```
  //'id' is now considered the key by which this section will be sorted by
  key: 'id'
  ```
