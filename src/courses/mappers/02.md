### HDF Schema <a name="fullschema"></a>

The full generalized HDF schema is as follows:

```
{
  platform: {                      //required field
    name                          //required field
    release                       //required field
    target_id
   }
  version                          //required field

   }

            }
          ]
        }
      ]
      status
    }
  ]
  passthrough: {
    auxiliary_data: [
      0: {
        name
        data
      }
    ]
    raw
  }
}
```

(Note: The documented schema is subject to change and not all required fields need to be populated; for the full schema and more information on the fields, refer to [saf.mitre.org/#/normalize](https://saf.mitre.org/#/normalize))
