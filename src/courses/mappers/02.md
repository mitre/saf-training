## What is OHDF?

OASIS Heimdall Data Format (OHDF) is a security data format used to normalize generated data exports from various security tools into a single common data format usable by the Security Automation Framework (SAF) tool suite. The format is defined by the [OHDF schema](https://saf.mitre.org/framework/normalize/ohdf-schema) and its goal is to provide a simple and intuitive means for representing security validation profiles, controls, and results.

OASIS Open is an international standards body that works on the development and advancement of open source technological standards. OHDF is currently in the process of becoming an OASIS Open standard.

## Why OHDF?

- Many security tools do not provide context to relevant compliance standards for comparison across security tools.​
- Security tools typically generate data in unique formats that require multiple dashboards and utilities to process.​
- OHDF reduces the time it takes to process security assessments, data in disparate locations, and inconsistent semantics of a data element between formats.​

## Features

### 1. Consistent integration, aggregation, and analysis of security data from all available sources.​

- Enforces consistent schema fields through consciously designed data format mappings.
- Supports data format conversion from numerous established security tools such as AWS Security Hub's AWS Security Finding Format (ASFF) and Tenable Nessus' Nessus file format.
- Allows the integration of currently unsupported security tool data formats through the development of OHDF mappers for the OHDF Converters tool.

### 2. Preserving data integrity with original source data.

- Uses mappings which maximize meaningful schema field conversions.
- Leverages schema fields `passthrough` and `raw` to preserve the original data in its entirety.
- Allows for bidirectional format conversions to and from OHDF.

### 3. Maximizing interoperability and data sharing.​

- Provides a consistent and standardized format for communication.
- Provides an easily ingestible data format and tools to improve user readability.

### 4. Facilitating the transformation and transport of data between security/management processes or technologies.​

- Provides a clear schema for technologies/processes to support.
- Includes a simple file format that technologies/processes can accept.

### 5. Allowing for the mapping and enrichment of security data to relevant compliance standards (GDPR, NIST SP 800-53, CCIs, PCI-DSS, etc.).

- Uses mappers which provide and append relevant compliance standards to converted security tool data.

this is gonna be an area where we actually do a lot of background knowledge training for the student. do one of those aside sections to provide background and context for rmf and then nist 800-53 and then cci. link the latest version of the documents and show an example of nist control family / cci


:::details Aside: More on RMF, NIST 800-53, and CCI

The Risk Management Framework (**RMF**) is a general process that integrates security, privacy, and risk management activities into the development life cycle. More info can be found [here](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/risk-management/about-rmf). 

National Institute of Standards and Technology (**NIST 800-53**) is a compliance standard created by the US government that contains a set of rules that every system must fulfill. More info can be found [here](https://secureframe.com/blog/nist-800-53-compliance). Here is an example of a NIST control:

```
AC-12: Session Termination

Automatically terminate a user session after [Assignment: organization-defined conditions, or trigger events requiring session disconnect].
```

Control Correlation Identifiers (**CCIs**) are standard identifiers and descriptions that aim to correlate high-level policy expressions and low-level technical implementations. More info can be found [here](https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/cci/#:~:text=The%20Control%20Correlation%20Identifier%20%28CCI%29%20provides%20a%20standard,between%20high-level%20policy%20expressions%20and%20low-level%20technical%20implementations.). Here is an example of a CCI:
```
CCI-000002: Disseminate the organization-level; mission/business process-level; and/or system-level access control policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance to organization-defined personnel or roles.
