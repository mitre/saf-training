## What is OHDF?

OASIS Heimdall Data Format (OHDF) is a security data format used to normalize generated data exports from various security tools into a single common data format usable by the Security Automation Framework (SAF) tool suite. The format is defined by the [OHDF schema](https://saf.mitre.org/framework/normalize/ohdf-schema) and its goal is to provide a simple and intuitive means for representing security validation profiles, controls, and results.

## Why OHDF?

- Many security tools do not provide context to relevant compliance standards for comparison across security tools.​
- Security tools typically generate data in unique formats that require multiple dashboards and utilities to process.​
- OHDF reduces the time it takes to process security assessments, data in disparate locations, and inconsistent semantics of a data element between formats.​

## Features

### 1. Consistent integration, aggregation, and analysis of security data from all available sources.​

- Enforces consistent schema fields through consciously designed data format mappings.
- Supports data format conversion from numerous established security tools such as AWS Security Hub's AWS Security Finding Format (ASFF) and Tenable Nessus' Nessus file format.
- Allows the integration of currently unsupported security tool data formats through the development of OHDF mappers for the OHDF Converters tool.

### 2. Preserving data integrity with original source data.

- Uses mappings which maximize meaningful schema field conversions.
- Leverages schema fields `passthrough` and `raw` to preserve the original data in its entirety.
- Allows for bidirectional format conversions to and from OHDF.

### 3. Maximizing interoperability and data sharing.​

- Provides a consistent and standardized format for communication.
- Provides an easily ingestible data format and tools to improve user readability.

### 4. Facilitating the transformation and transport of data between security/management processes or technologies.​

- Provides a clear schema for technologies/processes to support.
- Includes a simple file format that technologies/processes can accept.

### 5. Allowing for the mapping and enrichment of security data to relevant compliance standards (GDPR, NIST SP 800-53, PCI-DSS, etc.).

- Uses mappers which provide and append relevant compliance standards to converted security tool data.
