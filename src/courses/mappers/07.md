## Required OHDF Schema Fields

Not all fields in the schema have to be filled or even used in an OHDF mapper. In practice, most implementations either provide a blank field or omit an unused field entirely.

Note that just because you can skip a schema field does not mean that you should. Always aim to maximize the filled fields in your mapper and only skip a field as a last resort if no applicable equivalent exists in your source data. Consider required fields as priority fields that you should aim to fill out first instead of the bare minimum necessary to create a mapper.

The fields that are specifically required by the schema are as follows:

::: details Required Fields
```
{
  platform: {
    name,
    release
  },
  version,
  statistics,
  profiles: [
    0: {
      name,
      sha256,
      supports,
      attributes,
      groups,
      controls: [
        0: {
          id,
          impact,
          refs,
          tags,
          source_location,
          results: [
            0: {
              code_desc,
              start_time
            },
          ]
        },
      ]
    },
  ]
}
```
