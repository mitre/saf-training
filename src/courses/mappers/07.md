## OHDF Schema Review

Now that you've familiarized yourself with the formal OHDF schema, let's revisit the GoSec and Twistlock examples and analyze both the original source data and how it has been converted to OHDF.

Here are some key questions to keep note of while reading through these examples:

- How is the source data structured/organized (e.g., by requirement, by target system, by finding)?
- Is the source data's data format perfectly aligned to OHDF?
  - What should we do when multiple source data fields correspond to the same OHDF field?
  - How should we handle a source data field that contains information correlating to multiple OHDF fields?
  - How should we handle source data fields that don't fit into the OHDF schema?
- How is the structure of the source data interpreted to fit the OHDF hierarchy?
  - What groups of fields in the source data correlate to our <i>Profiles</i>, <i>Controls</i>, and <i>Results</i> structures?
- Which fields in the source data are used to fill each OHDF field? Is that mapping accurate?
  - Can you think of a reason for why that field is used to populate the OHDF field?
  - Are there any fields in the source data that you believe are more applicable? Why?
- Which fields are unfilled/omitted?
  - Can you think of a reason for why that field is unfilled/omitted?
  - Are there any fields in the source data that you believe are applicable? Why?

These questions will help you understand the conversion process for when you create your own OHDF mappers later.

:::note Sample Files
The sample files below are truncated for pedagogical purposes.

For the original files and more examples of actual OHDF samples used in production, see [here](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2/tree/master/libs/hdf-converters/sample_jsons).
