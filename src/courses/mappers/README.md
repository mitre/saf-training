## Overview

The purpose of this class is to provide you with the foundational knowledge needed to create data format mappers for mapping data to the [OASIS Heimdall Data Format (OHDF)](https://saf.mitre.org/framework/normalize). In the following course, you will be taught the art and science of schema translation through a combination of both guided walkthroughs and hands-on demonstrations.

The class is split into 2 sections

### Objectives

By the end of this class, you should be able to achieve the following objectives:

- Understand the OHDF schema and its components.
- Be able to identify and break down key components of any given security tool export.
- Correlate schema fields of your security data export to schema fields in OHDF.
- Create a *-to-OHDF mapper.
- Integrate your mapper with the [OHDF Converters](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2/tree/master/libs/hdf-converters) library.


## Mapper Examples

This course will use examples and code derived from previously developed OHDF mappers which can be [found here](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2/tree/master/libs/hdf-converters).

You are encouraged to regularly refer back to this GitHub repository to check your understanding of OHDF mappers and see how mappers are actually developed and implemented in a production environment.
