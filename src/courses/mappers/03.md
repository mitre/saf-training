## Where Is OHDF Used?

The SAF has five core capabilities, which you can read more about [here](../user/03.md). Here is how OHDF relates to these five pillars:

- **Plan**: The OHDF spec is written such that it includes all the information described in the guidance, as well as all the relavant metadata. Thus, the information is carried alongside the results. 
- **Harden**: The OHDF spec is not really relevant in this case. 
- **Validate**: InSpec's results format is a subset of the OHDF spec. This means that InSpec itself is natively supported! Moreover, it's easy to write InSpec such that all the guidance information is passed through into both the OHDF profile and OHDF results formats. 
- **Normalize**: Normalization is the primary use of OHDF. With the use of OHDF Converters, we are able to map many different security results formats to a standard format (OHDF). These converters can either be implemented directly, or accessed via the SAF CLI. 
- **Visualize**: OHDF is ingested by a variety of tools (ex. Heimdall) and transformed in many different ways. For example, a results file can be turned into a threshold file for pipeline use, turned into a POAM for ingestion by eMASS, or ingested by Heimdall directly for display purposes.

## What Is InspecJS?

[InspecJS](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2/tree/master/libs/inspecjs) is a library that provides schema definitions, classes, and utilities for OHDF file handling. InspecJS plays a pivotal role in the contextualization process where it converts the individual statuses for each finding into an overall status for the control.

## What Is OHDF Converters?

[OHDF Converters](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2/tree/master/libs/hdf-converters) is a custom data normalization library which leverages OHDF mappers for transforming various security data formats to and from OHDF. It is currently integrated into [Heimdall](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2) and the [SAF CLI](https://github.com/mitre/saf), which collectively are part of the [Security Automation Framework (SAF)](https://saf.mitre.org/#/), a set of tools and processes which aim to standardize and ease security compliance testing and verification within an automated build pipeline.

## What Is the SAF CLI?

The [SAF CLI](https://github.com/mitre/saf) is a tool that provides various automation support functions for CI/CD. One of its main functions is the `saf convert` command, which allows for the conversion of data between OHDF and several supported security tool data formats.

## What Is Heimdall?

[Heimdall](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2) is a visualization tool that provides a GUI-based means for managing and analyzing security data. Data that is imported into Heimdall is automatically converted to OHDF through OHDF Converters, which serves as the underlying library that services data format conversion requests in Heimdall.
