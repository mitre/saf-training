## Demo Introduction

Now that you've finished learning about OHDF and setting up your environment, we can start creating some OHDF mappers.

The rest of this course will consist of practice examples demonstrating and explaining the what's, how's and why's of OHDF mapper creation with a focus on practical examples derived from mappers used in a production setting. You are encouraged to actively follow along with the examples and recreate them in your own environment.
