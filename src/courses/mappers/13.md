## Mapping Introduction

::: note Security Tool Type
This walkthrough is targeted at converting security scans to OHDF. If your security tool provides exports that are not security scans or are APIs, contact the SAF team for further instruction on how to develop those services into a OHDF mapper.
:::

We begin the creation of every OHDF mapper by first planning out how we want correlate the fields in the OHDF and security tool's schemas. This mapping is important for the following reasons:

1. It gives us a good framework for guiding how we actually implement the *-to-OHDF mapper.
2. It notifies us of potential knowledge gaps we may have of a security tool's schema. We need to close these gaps as best as we can in order to ensure that we can create schema field correlations that are as accurate/applicable as possible.
3.

WORKING TO REFACTOR FOLLOWING SECTION

[placeholder]
The following is an example of a high-level mapping from the Twistlock file format to the HDF. The purpose of this demonstration is to give an easy, non-technical approach to generating a prototype for \*-to-HDF mappers that can be used as a guideline for the development of actual technical mappers for the HDF Converter. This process is generally recommended as the first step for the development of any mapper for the HDF Converter. 

(NOTE: The format used by your export may not match the one being used in this demonstration. The mappings used in this example are for demonstration purposes and should not be taken as a definitive resource; creative interpretation is necessary for the most accurate mapping according to the specifics of your security service export.)

Given a sample Twistlock scan export (as seen below), our goal is to roughly identify and group data fields according to our 3 primary structures in HDF (<i>profiles</i>, <i>controls</i>, and <i>results</i>) and the non-applicable structure (<i>passthrough</i>). For <i>profiles</i>, we want to find metadata; for <i>controls</i>, we want to find general security control information; for <i>results</i>, we want to find specific security control testing information; and we can place everything else into <i>passthrough</i>.

```

This flaw allows an attacker posing as an SSL/TLS server to trigger this issue in a client application compiled with NSS when it tries to initiate an SSL/TLS connection.  Similarly, a server application compiled with NSS, which processes client certificates, can receive a malicious certificate via a client, triggering the flaw. The highest threat to this vulnerability is confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.              STATEMENT: The issue is not limited to TLS. Any applications that use NSS certificate verification are vulnerable; S/MIME is impacted as well.  Similarly, a server application compiled with NSS, which processes client certificates, can receive a malicious certificate via a client.  Firefox is not vulnerable to this flaw as it uses the mozilla::pkix for certificate verification. Thunderbird is affected when parsing email with the S/MIME signature.  Thunderbird on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 and later does not need to be updated since it uses the system NSS library, but earlier Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 extended life streams will need to update Thunderbird as well as NSS.             MITIGATION: Red Hat has investigated whether a possible mitigation exists for this issue, and has not been able to identify a practical example. Please update the affec",

}
```

Thus, upon successive passes we can roughly outline what we expect each data field in the Twistlock scan export to correlate to in the HDF. We first want to identify metadata which will most likely belong in the <i>profiles</i> structure. Such data fields will primarily be related to the general security scan itself or be related to the target system that is being scanned, as seen below:

```
//Data values are removed for visual clarity
{
  "results": [
    {
      "id",                               //Scan target metadata -> profiles
      "name",                             //
      "distro",                           //
      "distroRelease",                    //
      "digest",                           //
      "collections",                      //
      "packages": [],                     //
      "vulnerabilities": [
        {
          "id",
          "status",
          "cvss",
          "description",
          "severity",
          "packageName",
          "packageVersion",
          "link",
          "riskFactors": [],
          "impactedVersions": [],
          "publishedDate",
          "discoveredDate",
          "layerTime"
        }
      ],
      "vulnerabilityDistribution": {},      //Twistlock scan metadata -> profiles
      "vulnerabilityScanPassed",            //
      "history": [],                        //Scan target package install history -> profiles
      "scanTime",                           //Twistlock scan metadata -> profiles
      "scanID"                              //
    }
  ],
  "consoleURL"         //Twistlock scan metadata -> profiles
}
```

Next, we want to roughly outline general security control information that correlates to our <i>controls</i> structure. For this, we want to look for information that provides a background for the tests performed by the security service. Usually, this strongly correlates to information that gives us a <i>why</i>, <i>what</i>, and <i>how</i> for the tests that are performed, as seen with the fields that are highlighted below:

```
//Data values are removed for visual clarity
{
  "results": [
    {
      "id",                               //Scan target metadata -> profiles
      "name",                             //
      "distro",                           //
      "distroRelease",                    //
      "digest",                           //
      "collections",                      //
      "packages": [],                     //
      "vulnerabilities": [
        {
          "id",                      //ID of control tested against -> controls
          "status",
          "cvss",                    //CVSS severity score of control -> controls
          "description",             //Description of control -> controls
          "severity",                //Severity of control failure -> controls
          "packageName",
          "packageVersion",
          "link",                    //Link to control documentation -> controls
          "riskFactors": [],
          "impactedVersions": [],
          "publishedDate",           //Control discovery date -> controls
          "discoveredDate",
          "layerTime"
        }
      ],
      "vulnerabilityDistribution": {},      //Twistlock scan metadata -> profiles
      "vulnerabilityScanPassed",            //
      "history": [],                        //Scan target package install history -> profiles
      "scanTime",                           //Twistlock scan metadata -> profiles
      "scanID"                              //
    }
  ],
  "consoleURL"         //Twistlock scan metadata -> profiles
}
```

After that, we want to outline items that relate to specific instances of control tests ran against the scan target as part of the <i>results</i> structure. Usually, this strongly correlates to information that gives us a <i>who</i>, <i>what</i>, and <i>when</i> for the specific tests that are performed, as seen with the fields that are highlighted below:

```
//Data values are removed for visual clarity
{
  "results": [
    {
      "id",                               //Scan target metadata -> profiles
      "name",                             //
      "distro",                           //
      "distroRelease",                    //
      "digest",                           //
      "collections",                      //
      "packages": [],                     //
      "vulnerabilities": [
        {
          "id",                      //ID of control tested against -> controls
          "status",                  //Pass/fail result of the control test -> results
          "cvss",                    //CVSS severity score of control -> controls
          "description",             //Description of control -> controls
          "severity",                //Severity of control failure -> controls
          "packageName",             //Package ran against control test -> results
          "packageVersion",          //Version of package ran against control test -> results
          "link",                    //Link to control documentation -> controls
          "riskFactors": [],         //Risk factors associated with failing this specific control test -> results
          "impactedVersions": [],    //Vulnerable versions of package ran against control test -> results
          "publishedDate",           //Control discovery date -> controls
          "discoveredDate",          //Date this control result was discovered -> results
          "layerTime"
        }
      ],
      "vulnerabilityDistribution": {},      //Twistlock scan metadata -> profiles
      "vulnerabilityScanPassed",            //
      "history": [],                        //Scan target package install history -> profiles
      "scanTime",                           //Twistlock scan metadata -> profiles
      "scanID"                              //
    }
  ],
  "consoleURL"         //Twistlock scan metadata -> profiles
}
```

For fields that we cannot reasonably categorize or have no information about, we can instead just place them into the <i>passthrough</i> structure, as seen below:

```
//Data values are removed for visual clarity
{
  "results": [
    {
      "id",                               //Scan target metadata -> profiles
      "name",                             //
      "distro",                           //
      "distroRelease",                    //
      "digest",                           //
      "collections",                      //
      "packages": [],                     //
      "vulnerabilities": [
        {
          "id",                      //ID of control tested against -> controls
          "status",                  //Pass/fail result of the control test -> results
          "cvss",                    //CVSS severity score of control -> controls
          "description",             //Description of control -> controls
          "severity",                //Severity of control failure -> controls
          "packageName",             //Package ran against control test -> results
          "packageVersion",          //Version of package ran against control test -> results
          "link",                    //Link to control documentation -> controls
          "riskFactors": [],         //Risk factors associated with failing this specific control test -> results
          "impactedVersions": [],    //Vulnerable versions of package ran against control test -> results
          "publishedDate",           //Control discovery date -> controls
          "discoveredDate",          //Date this control result was discovered -> results
          "layerTime"                //Information on package install time; extraneous -> passthrough
        }
      ],
      "vulnerabilityDistribution": {},      //Twistlock scan metadata -> profiles
      "vulnerabilityScanPassed",            //
      "history": [],                        //Scan target package install history -> profiles
      "scanTime",                           //Twistlock scan metadata -> profiles
      "scanID"                              //
    }
  ],
  "consoleURL"         //Twistlock scan metadata -> profiles
}
```

With this, we now have a general outline which roughly connects each data field in the Twistlock sample export to one of our structures in the HDF. In order to improve the accuracy of this mapping, we can now begin connecting <b>[specific fields in the HDF schema](#fullschema)</b> with the data fields in the sample export using our rough draft as a guide.

If we cannot find a field in the HDF schema that fits with a certain field in the sample export per our original groupings, we can instead look to the other structures to see if they have applicable fields or place the field into the <i>passthrough</i> structure as a last resort.

```
//Data values are removed for visual clarity

  "results": [
    {
      "id",                               //profiles -> passthrough.auxiliary_data.data
      "name",                             //profiles -> profiles.name
      "distro",                           //profiles -> passthrough.auxiliary_data.data
      "distroRelease",                    //profiles -> passthrough.auxiliary_data.data
      "digest",                           //profiles -> passthrough.auxiliary_data.data
      "collections",                      //profiles -> profiles.title
      "packages": [],                     //profiles -> passthrough.auxiliary_data.data
      "vulnerabilities": [
        {
          "id",                      //controls -> profiles.controls.id
          "status",                  //results -> profiles.controls.results.status
          "cvss",                    //controls -> profiles.controls.code
          "description",             //controls -> profiles.controls.desc

          "layerTime"                //passthrough -> profiles.controls.code
        }
      ],
      "vulnerabilityDistribution": {},      //profiles -> profiles.summary
      "vulnerabilityScanPassed",            //profiles -> passthrough.auxiliary_data.data
      "history": [],                        //profiles -> passthrough.auxiliary_data.data
      "scanTime",                           //profiles -> passthrough.auxiliary_data.data
      "scanID"                              //profiles -> passthrough.auxiliary_data.data
    }
  ],
  "consoleURL"         //profiles -> passthrough.auxiliary_data.data
}
```

With this, we now have a detailed high-level mapping for the conversion from an external file format to the HDF, which we can use for the <b>[technical implementation of a \*-to-HDF mapper](#create)</b>.
