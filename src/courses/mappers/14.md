The following are some practice source data sets to create mappers with.

Before you begin, recall the steps we took previously to develop our GoSec and DBProtect mappers:

1. Examine and break down the security data format. Remember to ask yourself the following questions while analyzing the fields of your security data:

- What is the purpose of this field?

- What is this field recording (i.e., metadata, requirements, requirement testing)?

2. Correlate your security data to the OHDF schema. Focus on correlating fields from order of obvious to less obvious.

::: details Empty OHDF Schema

```typescript
{
  platform: {
    name,
    release,
    target_id
  },
  version,
  statistics: {
    duration
  },
  profiles: [
    {
      name,
      version,
      sha256,
      title,
      maintainer,
      summary,
      license,
      copyright,
      copyright_email,
      supports,
      attributes,
      groups,
      controls: [
        {
          id,
          title,
          desc,
          descriptions,
          impact,
          refs,
          tags,
          code,
          source_location,
          results: [
            {
              status,
              code_desc,
              message,
              run_time,
              start_time
            }
          ]
        },
      ],
      status
    },
  ],
  passthrough: {
    auxiliary_data: [
      {
        name,
        data
      },
    ],
    raw
  }
}
```

3. Implement your mapping using the tools and resources provided in the [previous section](./14.md).

          "description": "DOCUMENTATION: A remote code execution flaw was found in the way NSS verifies certificates. This flaw allows an attacker posing as an SSL/TLS server to trigger this issue in a client application compiled with NSS when it tries to initiate an SSL/TLS connection.  Similarly, a server application compiled with NSS, which processes client certificates, can receive a malicious certificate via a client, triggering the flaw. The highest threat to this vulnerability is confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.              STATEMENT: The issue is not limited to TLS. Any applications that use NSS certificate verification are vulnerable; S/MIME is impacted as well.  Similarly, a server application compiled with NSS, which processes client certificates, can receive a malicious certificate via a client.  Firefox is not vulnerable to this flaw as it uses the mozilla::pkix for certificate verification. Thunderbird is affected when parsing email with the S/MIME signature.  Thunderbird on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 and later does not need to be updated since it uses the system NSS library, but earlier Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 extended life streams will need to update Thunderbird as well as NSS.             MITIGATION: Red Hat has investigated whether a possible mitigation exists for this issue, and has not been able to identify a practical example. Please update the affec",
