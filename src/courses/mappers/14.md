## Mapper Introduction

::: note OHDF Converters Keywords
Programming keyword functions from OHDF Converters are used here. [Refer here](./09.md) for a refresher on OHDF Converters.
:::

Now that we have developed a mapping, we can implement that mapping as a mapper which applies the mapping to any compatible file for a conversion to OHDF.

## File Set Up

A number of crucial files that support and provide the infrastructure needed for the *-to-OHDF mapper have to be set up first before we begin actual mapper development.

::: note Specialized Security Tools
This guide is geared for security tools that provide scan-based export data. If your security tool provides a specialized form of export data or is an API, contact the SAF team for further guidance.
:::

### Mapper File

First, we need to create the file that hosts the mapper and link to it so other files in OHDF Converters can access it.

1. Create a blank TypeScript file under the `src` directory in `hdf-converters`. It should be named:
```
{YOUR-EXPORT-NAME-HERE}-mapper.ts
```

2. Select the appropriate mapper skeleton (see below) for your export type. Place them in the file created in step 1. Replace names (`skeleton` by default) as necessary.

::: details JSON Mapper Skeleton
```typescript
import {ExecJSON} from 'inspecjs';
import _ from 'lodash';
import {version as HeimdallToolsVersion} from '../package.json';
import {
  BaseConverter,
  ILookupPath,
  impactMapping,
  MappedTransform
} from './base-converter';

const IMPACT_MAPPING: Map<string, number> = new Map([
  ['critical', 0.9],
  ['high', 0.7],
  ['medium', 0.5],
  ['low', 0.3]
]);

export class SkeletonMapper extends BaseConverter {
  withRaw: boolean;

  mappings: MappedTransform<
    ExecJSON.Execution & {passthrough: unknown},
    ILookupPath
  > = {
    platform: {
      name: 'Heimdall Tools',
      release: HeimdallToolsVersion,
      target_id: null  //Insert data
    },
    version: HeimdallToolsVersion,
    statistics: {
      duration: null  //Insert data
    },
    profiles: [
      {
        name: '',              //Insert data

        copyright_email: null, //Insert data
        supports: [],          //Insert data
        attributes: [],        //Insert data
        depends: [],           //Insert data
        groups: [],            //Insert data
        status: 'loaded',      //Insert data
        controls: [
          {
            key: 'id',
            tags: {},             //Insert data
            descriptions: [],     //Insert data
            refs: [],             //Insert data
            source_location: {},  //Insert data
            title: null,          //Insert data
            id: '',               //Insert data
            desc: null,           //Insert data
            impact: 0,            //Insert data
            code: null,           //Insert data
            results: [
              {
                status: ExecJSON.ControlResultStatus.Failed,  //Insert data
                code_desc: '',                                //Insert data
                message: null,                                //Insert data
                run_time: null,                               //Insert data
                start_time: ''                                //Insert data
              }
            ]
          }
        ],
        sha256: ''
      }
    ],
    passthrough: {
      transformer: (data: Record<string, any>): Record<string, unknown> => {
        return {
          auxiliary_data: [{name: '', data: _.omit([])}],  //Insert service name and mapped fields to be removed
          ...(this.withRaw && {raw: data})
        };
      }
    }
  };
  constructor(exportJson: string, withRaw = false) {
    super(JSON.parse(exportJson), true);
    this.withRaw = withRaw
  }
}
```

3. Export your mapper class created in the previous steps by specifying its export in the <i>index.ts</i> file. Add the following line:
```
export * from './src/{YOUR-EXPORT-NAME-HERE}-mapper';
```

### Sample File

Next, we need to add a sample file for the mapper to ingest when running unit tests on it.

1. Create a new directory named `{YOUR-EXPORT-NAME-HERE}_mapper` under the `sample_jsons` directory in `hdf-converters`. Create another directory named `sample_input_report` in the directory you just made. The directory structure should look like this:
```
+-- sample_jsons
|   +-- {YOUR-EXPORT-NAME-HERE}-mapper
|   |   +-- sample_input_report
```

2. Place your sample export under the `sample_input_report` directory. Your sample export should be genericized to avoid any leaking of sensitive information. The directory structure should now look like this:
```
+-- sample_jsons
|   +-- {YOUR-EXPORT-NAME-HERE}-mapper
|   |   +-- sample_input_report
|   |   |   +-- {YOUR-SAMPLE-EXPORT}
```
