## 2.1 Requirements

To conduct the delta process, the following items are needed:

1. An InSpec profile:
    a. Clone or download an existing profile from a repository source to your local environment.
    b. See [What is an InSpec Profile](../beginner/02.md#what-is-an-inspec-profile) for additional information.
2. A guidance file (XCCDF):
    a. Download either a DISA STIG Benchmark from the appropriate site.

::: details What if there is no existing InSpec profile?
If the InSpec profile for your target of interest does not exist, you can generate the profile stub from the `saf generate inspec_profile` command to create a skeleton profile structure based on the XCCDF benchmark guidance (STIG or CIS). This ensures consistency across profiles.

For more information on this command, refer to the documentation for [`inspec_profile`](https://saf-cli.mitre.org/#inspec-profile).

This command is similar to the Chef InSpec [Initialize a new profile](../beginner/03.md#creating-the-profile), but it uses the XCCDF content to configure (generate) the profile controls metadata and [supporting structure](../beginner/02.md#the-structure-of-an-inspec-profile).
