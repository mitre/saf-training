## Writing InSpec Controls

Let's work through some example requirements to write InSpec controls.

### Security & Configuration Requirements

Review the requirements we're testing for:

```sh
1. NGINX should be installed as version 1.27.0 or later.
2. The following NGINX modules should be installed:
   * `http_ssl`
   * `stream_ssl`
   * `mail_ssl`
3. The NGINX configuration file - `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`- should exist as a file.
4. The NGINX configuration file should:
   * be owned by the `root` user and group.
   * not be readable, writeable, or executable by others.
5. The NGINX shell access should be restricted to admin users.
```

### Requirement (1) - NGINX Version

The first requirement is for the NGINX version to be `1.27.0 or later`. 

We can check this using the InSpec `cmp` matcher.

 Replace the contents of `my_nginx/controls/example.rb` with this:

```ruby
control 'nginx-version' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'NGINX version'
  desc 'The required version of NGINX should be installed.'
  describe nginx do
    its('version') { should cmp >= '1.27.0' }
  end
end
```

:::tip The `nginx_conf` resource docs
[`nginx_conf`](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/resources/nginx_conf/)
:::

The test has an impact of 1.0, meaning it is considered a _critical_ issue if this test fails. A failure might indicate to the team that this issue should be resolved as soon as possible, likely by upgrading NGINX to a newer version. The test compares `nginx.version` against version 1.27.0.

`cmp` is one of InSpec's [built-in matchers](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/). `cmp` understands version numbers and can use the operators ==, <, <=, >=, and >. `cmp` compares versions by each segment, not as a string. For example, "7.4" is less than than "7.30".

Next, run `inspec exec` to execute the profile on the remote target.

::: code-tabs#shell

@tab Command - req 1
```sh
inspec exec ./my_nginx -t docker://nginx
```

@tab Generic Command - req 1
```sh
inspec exec /root/my_nginx -t docker://{DOCKER_CONTAINER_ID or DOCKER_CONTAINER_NAME}
```

@tab Output - req 1
```sh
  Profile: InSpec Profile (my_nginx)
  Version: 0.1.0
  Target:  docker://DOCKER_CONTAINER_ID
  Target ID: TARGET_ID

    ✔  nginx-version: NGINX version
       ✔  Nginx Environment version should cmp >= "1.27.0"


  Profile Summary: 1 successful control, 0 control failures, 0 controls skipped
  Test Summary: 1 successful, 0 failures, 0 skipped
```

:::

You see that the test passes. We get back our test results and some metadata about the target we ran it against. The 'Target ID' in the output is the UUID generated by InSpec to uniquely identify the target system/node.

### Requirement (2) - NGINX Modules are Installed

The second requirement verifies that our required modules are installed.

- http_ssl
- stream_ssl
- mail_ssl

Append your control file to add this describe block:

```ruby
control 'nginx-modules' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'NGINX modules'
  desc 'The required NGINX modules should be installed.'
  describe nginx do
    its('modules') { should include 'http_ssl' }
    its('modules') { should include 'stream_ssl' }
    its('modules') { should include 'mail_ssl' }
  end
end
```

The second control resembles the first; however, this version uses multiple `its` statements and the `nginx.modules` method. The `nginx.modules` method returns a list; the built-in `include` matcher verifies whether a value belongs to a given list.

Run `inspec exec` on the target.

::: code-tabs#shell

@tab Command - req 2
```sh
inspec exec ./my_nginx -t docker://nginx
```

@tab Generic Command - req 2
```sh
inspec exec /root/my_nginx -t docker://{DOCKER_CONTAINER_ID or DOCKER_CONTAINER_NAME}
```

@tab Output - req 2
```sh
  Profile: InSpec Profile (my_nginx)
  Version: 0.1.0
  Target:  docker://DOCKER_CONTAINER_ID
  Target ID: TARGET_ID

    ✔  nginx-version: NGINX version
       ✔  Nginx Environment version should cmp >= "1.27.0"
    ✔  nginx-modules: NGINX version
       ✔  Nginx Environment modules should include "http_ssl"
       ✔  Nginx Environment modules should include "stream_ssl"
       ✔  Nginx Environment modules should include "mail_ssl"


  Profile Summary: 2 successful controls, 0 control failures, 0 controls skipped
  Test Summary: 4 successful, 0 failures, 0 skipped
```

:::

This time, both controls pass.

### Requirement (3) - The `nginx_conf` file

The third requirement verifies that the NGINX configuration file - `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` - exists as a file.

Append this describe block to your control file:

```ruby
control 'nginx-conf-file' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'NGINX configuration file'
  desc 'The NGINX config file should exist as a file.'
  describe file('/etc/nginx/nginx.conf') do
    it { should be_file }
  end
end
```

Run `inspec exec` on the target.

::: code-tabs#shell

@tab Command - req 3
```sh
inspec exec ./my_nginx -t docker://nginx
```

@tab Generic Command - req 3
```sh
inspec exec /root/my_nginx -t docker://{DOCKER_CONTAINER_ID or DOCKER_CONTAINER_NAME}
```

@tab Output - req 3
```sh
Profile:   InSpec Profile (my_nginx)
Version:   0.1.0
Target:  docker://DOCKER_CONTAINER_ID
Target ID: TARGET_ID

  ✔  nginx-version: NGINX version
     ✔  Nginx Environment version is expected to cmp >= "1.27.0"
  ✔  nginx-modules: NGINX modules
     ✔  Nginx Environment modules is expected to include "http_ssl"
     ✔  Nginx Environment modules is expected to include "stream_ssl"
     ✔  Nginx Environment modules is expected to include "mail_ssl"
  ✔  nginx-conf-file: NGINX configuration file
     ✔  File /etc/nginx/nginx.conf is expected to be file


Profile Summary: 3 successful controls, 0 control failures, 0 controls skipped
Test Summary: 5 successful, 0 failures, 0 skipped
```

:::

### Requirement (4) - Permission on the `nginx_conf` file

The fourth requirement verifies that the NGINX configuration file, `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`:

- is owned by the root user and group.
- is not be readable, writeable, or executable by others.

Append your control file to add this describe block:

```ruby
control 'nginx-conf-perms' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'NGINX configuration'
  desc 'The NGINX config file should owned by root, be writable only by owner, and not writeable or and readable by others.'
  describe file('/etc/nginx/nginx.conf') do
    it { should be_owned_by 'root' }
    it { should be_grouped_into 'root' }
    it { should_not be_readable.by('others') }
    it { should_not be_writable.by('others') }
    it { should_not be_executable.by('others') }
  end
end
```

:::tip The `file` resource docs
[`file`](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/resources/file/) You can also [jump back](https://mitre.github.io/saf-training/courses/beginner/03.html#file) in the course for a refresher. 
:::

The first two tests use `should` to verify the `root` owner and group. The last three tests use `should_not` to verify that the file is not readable, writable, or executable by others.

Run `inspec exec` on the target.

::: code-tabs#shell

@tab Command - req 4
```sh
inspec exec ./my_nginx -t docker://nginx
```

@tab Generic Command - req 4
```sh
inspec exec /root/my_nginx -t docker://{DOCKER_CONTAINER_ID or DOCKER_CONTAINER_NAME}
```

@tab Output - req 4
```sh
Profile: InSpec Profile (my_nginx)
Version: 0.1.0
Target:  docker://DOCKER_CONTAINER_ID
Target ID: TARGET_ID

  ✔  nginx-version: NGINX version
     ✔  Nginx Environment version is expected to cmp >= "1.27.0"
  ✔  nginx-modules: NGINX modules
     ✔  Nginx Environment modules is expected to include "http_ssl"
     ✔  Nginx Environment modules is expected to include "stream_ssl"
     ✔  Nginx Environment modules is expected to include "mail_ssl"
  ✔  nginx-conf-file: NGINX configuration file
     ✔  File /etc/nginx/nginx.conf is expected to be file
  ×  nginx-conf-perms: NGINX configuration (1 failed)
     ✔  File /etc/nginx/nginx.conf is expected to be owned by "root"
     ✔  File /etc/nginx/nginx.conf is expected to be grouped into "root"
     ×  File /etc/nginx/nginx.conf is expected not to be readable by others
     expected File /etc/nginx/nginx.conf not to be readable by others
     ✔  File /etc/nginx/nginx.conf is expected not to be writable by others
     ✔  File /etc/nginx/nginx.conf is expected not to be executable by others


Profile Summary: 3 successful controls, 1 control failure, 0 controls skipped
Test Summary: 9 successful, 1 failure, 0 skipped
```

:::

This time you see a failure. You discover that `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` is potentially readable by others. Because this control also has an impact of 1.0, your team may need to investigate further.

### Requirement (5) - NGINX shell access

The last requirement checks whether NGINX shell access is provided to non-admin users. In this case, access to `bash` needs to be restricted to admin users.

Append this describe block to your control file:

```ruby
control 'nginx-shell-access' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'NGINX shell access'
  desc 'The NGINX shell access should be restricted to admin users.'
  describe users.shells(/bash/).usernames do
    it { should be_in ['admin']}
  end
end
```

Run `inspec exec` on the target.

::: code-tabs#shell

@tab Command - req 5
```sh
inspec exec ./my_nginx -t docker://nginx
```

@tab Generic Command - req 5
```sh
inspec exec /root/my_nginx -t docker://{DOCKER_CONTAINER_ID or DOCKER_CONTAINER_NAME}
```

@tab Output - req 5
```sh
Profile: InSpec Profile (my_nginx)
Version: 0.1.0
Target:  docker://DOCKER_CONTAINER_ID
Target ID: TARGET_ID

  ✔  nginx-version: NGINX version
     ✔  Nginx Environment version is expected to cmp >= "1.27.0"
  ✔  nginx-modules: NGINX modules
     ✔  Nginx Environment modules is expected to include "http_ssl"
     ✔  Nginx Environment modules is expected to include "stream_ssl"
     ✔  Nginx Environment modules is expected to include "mail_ssl"
  ✔  nginx-conf-file: NGINX configuration file
     ✔  File /etc/nginx/nginx.conf is expected to be file
  ×  nginx-conf-perms: NGINX configuration (1 failed)
     ✔  File /etc/nginx/nginx.conf is expected to be owned by "root"
     ✔  File /etc/nginx/nginx.conf is expected to be grouped into "root"
     ×  File /etc/nginx/nginx.conf is expected not to be readable by others
     expected File /etc/nginx/nginx.conf not to be readable by others
     ✔  File /etc/nginx/nginx.conf is expected not to be writable by others
     ✔  File /etc/nginx/nginx.conf is expected not to be executable by others
  ×  nginx-shell-access: NGINX shell access
     ×  ["root"] is expected to be in "admin"
     expected `["root"]` to be in the list: `["admin"]` 
     Diff:
      ["root"]


Profile Summary: 3 successful controls, 2 control failures, 0 controls skipped
Test Summary: 9 successful, 2 failures, 0 skipped
```

### Fixing Problems

Recall that what we're doing with InSpec falls under [MITRE SAF's Validate pillar](../beginner/README.md), which is where you identify where problems are with your software component, so that you can accurately assess risk and prioritize remediation actions. 

For the second step, Hardening (sometimes variously referred to as implementation or remediation) you can use a configuration management tool or some other automation framework to correct compliance failures for you. 

We're focused on InSpec right now, so we won't correct this issue right now, but you can check out the Chef [Secure your Infrastructure](https://learn.chef.io/tracks/integrated-compliance#/) tutorial course to learn more about how to correct compliance failures using Chef.
