## Refactoring the code to use Inputs

Your `my_nginx` profile is off to a great start. As your requirements evolve, you can add additional controls. You can also run this profile as often as you need to verify whether your systems remain in compliance.

Let's review the control file, `example.rb`.

```ruby
control 'nginx-version' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'NGINX version'
  desc 'The required version of NGINX should be installed.'
  describe nginx do
    its('version') { should cmp >= '1.27.0' }
  end
end

control 'nginx-modules' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'NGINX modules'
  desc 'The required NGINX modules should be installed.'
  describe nginx do
    its('modules') { should include 'http_ssl' }
    its('modules') { should include 'stream_ssl' }
    its('modules') { should include 'mail_ssl' }
  end
end

control 'nginx-conf-file' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'NGINX configuration file'
  desc 'The NGINX config file should exist.'
  describe file('/etc/nginx/nginx.conf') do
    it { should be_file }
  end
end

control 'nginx-conf-perms' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'NGINX configuration'
  desc 'The NGINX config file should owned by root, be writable only by owner, and not writeable or and readable by others.'
  describe file('/etc/nginx/nginx.conf') do
    it { should be_owned_by 'root' }
    it { should be_grouped_into 'root' }
    it { should_not be_readable.by('others') }
    it { should_not be_writable.by('others') }
    it { should_not be_executable.by('others') }
  end
end

control 'nginx-shell-access' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'NGINX shell access'
  desc 'The NGINX shell access should be restricted to admin users.'
  describe users.shells(/bash/).usernames do
    it { should be_in ['admin']}
  end
end

control 'nginx-interview' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'NGINX interview'
  desc 'NGINX admins should have documentation on security procedures.'

  describe "Manual Review" do
    skip "This control must be manually reviewed."
  end
end
```

Although these controls are straightforward, imagine if your `controls` directory contained dozens or _hundreds_ of tests, like we might see for a real security validation profile. Many of these tests will be referring to the same test values over and over again -- what happens when we need to change them? Or if I want to test to a different standard and want to adjust the values the tests are looking for? For example, what happens when a new major release of NGINX happens, and we want to test to make sure our deployed webserver is still up to date with the new latest version?

One way to improve these tests is to use `inputs`. Inputs enable you to separate the _logic of your tests_ from the _data of your tests_.  Inputs can be provided in-line with your invocation of `inspec exec` but they can also be stored in `input files` and placed under version control.  Input files should be in the `YAML` format (files ending in `.yaml` or `.yml`).

Profile inputs are defined in your profile's main directory within the `inspec.yml`. These global `inputs` can be used across all the controls in your profile.

Let's add an input to the `inspec.yml` file for our profile:

```yaml
name: my_nginx
title: InSpec Profile
maintainer: The Authors
copyright: The Authors
copyright_email: you@example.com
license: Apache-2.0
summary: An InSpec Compliance Profile
version: 0.1.0
supports:
  platform: os

inputs:
  - name: nginx_version
    type: String
    value: 1.27.0
```

Now that we have defined the `nginx_version` input, we can access it in any control by using the `input` keyword and passing in its name.

For example:

```ruby
control 'nginx-version' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'NGINX version'
  desc 'The required version of NGINX should be installed.'
  describe nginx do
    its('version') { should cmp >= input('nginx_version') }
  end
end
```

Since we gave the input a default value of `1.27.0`, that value will be passed down to the control from `inspec.yml` at runtime and nothing about the control's returned results will change from before.

We have now swapped out a hard-coded value in the control with a parameter. This is the process of _parameterization_. It is a common practice during InSpec profile development, where profile authors will write their controls and then read through them to look for values that are hardcoded that could be easily replaced with an input.

Keep in mind that these inputs are **constants**.  Their values should not and do not change during the execution of the program.  If you want the input to have a different value, we will **override** them using an inputs file. 

::: tip
A good rule of thumb is that any check of a numerical value in an InSpec profile should be replaced with an input.
:::

The next control checks whether certain NGINX modules are installed. Let's make an input to represent an array of modules we want to check for.

Example of adding an array object of servers:

::: code-tabs#shell

@tab Array Input Generic
```yaml
  - name: servers
    type: Array
    value:
      - server1
      - server2
      - server3
```

@tab Array Input - NGINX Modules
```yaml
  - name: nginx_modules
    type: Array
    value:
      - http_ssl
      - stream_ssl
      - mail_ssl
```

@tab Full inspec.yml file
```yaml{17-22}
name: my_nginx
title: InSpec Profile
maintainer: The Authors
copyright: The Authors
copyright_email: you@example.com
license: Apache-2.0
summary: An InSpec Compliance Profile
version: 0.1.0
supports:
  platform: os

inputs:
  - name: nginx_version
    type: String
    value: 1.27.0

  - name: nginx_modules
    type: Array
    value:
      - http_ssl
      - stream_ssl
      - mail_ssl
```

:::

Your control can now be updated to look like this:

```ruby
control 'nginx-modules' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'NGINX modules'
  desc 'The required NGINX modules should be installed.'

  nginx_modules = input('nginx_modules')
  
  describe nginx do
    nginx_modules.each do |current_module|
      its('modules') { should include current_module }
    end
  end
end
```

Lastly, we can edit our `inspec.yml` file to create a list of admin users:

::: code-tabs#shell

@tab Array Input - Admin Users
```yaml
  - name: admin_users
    type: Array
    value:
      - admin
```

@tab Full inspec.yml file
```yaml{24-27}
name: my_nginx
title: InSpec Profile
maintainer: The Authors
copyright: The Authors
copyright_email: you@example.com
license: Apache-2.0
summary: An InSpec Compliance Profile
version: 0.1.0
supports:
  platform: os

inputs:
  - name: nginx_version
    type: String
    value: 1.27.0

  - name: nginx_modules
    type: Array
    value:
      - http_ssl
      - stream_ssl
      - mail_ssl

  - name: admin_users
    type: Array
    value:
      - admin
```

:::

Your fifth control can be changed to look like this:

```ruby
control 'nginx-shell-access' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'NGINX shell access'
  desc 'The NGINX shell access should be restricted to admin users.'
  describe users.shells(/bash/).usernames do
    it { should be_in input('admin_users')}
  end
end
```

## Overriding Inputs with 

We have now defined and parameterized a set of default values for our controls. But what if we want to change those defaults at some point? We can pass in our own values for inputs when we run `inspec exec` to ensure that each individual run of InSpec uses the values we want.

Create a file inside your `my_nginx` profile:

``` yaml
admin_users:
  - admin
  - root
```

Note that we are invoking an input name that we defined back in the `inspec.yml` file (`admin_users`). We are now overriding the default value by adding the `root` account to our list of valid account names.

Remember how our test for requirement 5 was failing because we found an account named `root` when we were expecting the name `admin`? We can now tell InSpec that we were intending to look for an account named `root`, and very importantly, we can do it without having to edit either our control code itself or the `inspec.yml` file.

When using InSpec in the real world, we want a strong separation between our underlying test code (the profile itself) and the environment-specific parameters we pass to it (the inputs). Therefore, we _never_ edit the `inspec.yml` file to simply erase the default values and put in our own; we will instead use InSpec's ability to _override_ input values via an inputs file.

Let's re-run the profile and pass it our custom inputs. 


::: code-tabs#shell

@tab Command
```sh
inspec exec my_nginx -t docker://nginx --input-file
```

@tab Output - `--input-file` flag
```sh

:::

And there we are, requirement 5 is now correctly indicating that the test is a pass.

Notice that all the other tests besides number 5 _did not_ change -- we didn't specifically override the inputs for those ones in the inputs file, so InSpec did not change the default values.

### Passing Inputs Via the `--input` Flags

There are [many ways](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/profiles/inputs) to pass an input to InSpec at runtime. InSpec [prioritizes](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/profiles/inputs/#input-priority) input values differently depending on where the value comes from.

For example, we can pass an input directly on the terminal line using a different flag:

::: code-tabs#shell

@tab Command
```sh
inspec exec my_nginx -t docker://nginx --input=admin_users=['root']
```

@tab Output - `--input` flag
```sh

The test still passes.

### Keeping Multiple Input Files

To change your inputs for platform specific cases, you can set up multiple input files.

For example, an NGINX web server could be run on a Windows or Linux machine, which may require different admin users for each context. The inputs can be tailored for each system. You can create a `inputs-windows.yml` *and* `inputs-linux.yml` file in your home directory and only pass the one you actually need to InSpec at runtime.

::: note
Another example is that production and development environments may require different inputs.
:::

::: code-tabs#shell

@tab inputs-windows.yml
```yaml
admin_users:
  - Administrator
  - Randy
```

@tab inputs-linux.yml
```yaml
admin_users:
  - root
  - randy
```

The following command runs the tests and applies the inputs specified on the Linux system underlying the NGINX application in the container:

```sh
inspec exec my_nginx -t docker://nginx --input-file inputs.yml
```

If we'd wanted to do this on a hypothetical Windows system, we would need to create a new inputs file and change our target to an NGINX instance hosted on a Windows container or virtual machine:  

```sh
inspec exec my_nginx -t docker://windows-nginx --input-file inputs-windows.yml
```

We can pass different inputs files in different situations as needed. We could also, for instance, send a different set of values to check with InSpec depending on whether the target of evaluation is deployed to the development or production environment.
