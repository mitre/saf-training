## Check-In

::: details  Have you used InSpec before?
There is no right or wrong answer. If this is your first time using InSpec, welcome! If you have used it before, welcome back. If you want more information on the basics of Ruby (InSpec is built on Ruby), take a look at the Ruby materials linked on the [home page](../../).
:::

::: details Which goal of the MITRE Security Automation Framework (SAF) is supported by InSpec?
InSpec is used in the [Validate pillar](https://saf.mitre.org/#/validate). InSpec is used to do security validation.

_Note that InSpec is not the only validation solution, but the one preferred by the MITRE SAF team. You are not required to use InSpec to use the rest of MITRE SAF's approach to security._
:::

::: details Is your Codespace environment set up successfully?
This class will have hands-on activities. The class contents are written assuming that you are following along using the recommended [development lab environment](https://github.com/mitre/saf-training-lab-environment), which leverages GitHub Codespaces to give you a stable development VM. All you need is to login with a [GitHub](https://github.com/signup) account (which you can make for free), and follow the directions in the [README.md](https://github.com/mitre/saf-training-lab-environment#readme).

To setup your environment, run `source ./build-lab.sh`. This script will install all of the dependencies we will be using in this class, not the least of which is the executable InSpec binary itself.  You can validate that everything is up and running properly by running `./test-lab.sh`.  If anything goes wrong or gets misconfigured, you can just run `source ./build-lab.sh` again.

## What is an InSpec Profile?

### InSpec Profiles  

InSpec organizes its code into `profiles`. A `profile` is a collection of automated tests. In real-world contexts, if we are testing a system for security, we are running tests based off of some security guidance documentation -- such as a [Center for Internet Security (CIS) Benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks) or one of the [Defense Information Security Agency (DISA) Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIGs)](https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/) - and provides an organized structure to articulate that set of requirements using tests in code.

If you have read the [MITRE SAF Guidance Class](../../courses/guidance/README.md), you may recall that a security guidance document can often be expressed as a structured, machine-readable dataset. We like to think of the human-friendly security guidance documentation that you may read as a developer, and the implementation of that guidance using a testing tool such as InSpec, as ultimately two different ways of formatting the same data about security requirements.

**Profiles have two (2) required elements:**
- An `inspec.yml` file 
- A `controls` directory

**and four (4) optional elements:**
- A `libraries` directory 
- A `files` directory
- An `inputs.yml` file 
- A `README.md` file

You can learn all the details here: <https://docs.chef.io/inspec/profiles/>

We will be discussing the purpose and function of each of these elements during this class.

### The Structure of an InSpec Profile

```sh
# Example profile structure
$ tree nginx
      nginx
      └── profile

          ├── controls
          │   ├── V-2230.rb
          │   └── V-2232.rb
          ├── files

### The Structure of an InSpec Control

Let's start off by taking a glance at what a quality InSpec control looks like when complete. This example is taken from the [InSpec profile](https://github.com/mitre/redhat-enterprise-linux-9-stig-baseline) that the MITRE SAF team developed to assess a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 operating system against its STIG security guidance documentation.

[redhat-enterprise-linux-9-stig-baseline/controls/SV-257791.rb](https://github.com/mitre/redhat-enterprise-linux-9-stig-baseline/blob/46fd72d144fcda10b07604df037db7f683b74225/controls/SV-257791.rb)

```ruby 
control 'SV-257791' do
  title 'RHEL 9 /boot/grub2/grub.cfg file must be owned by root.'
  desc 'The " /boot/grub2/grub.cfg" file stores sensitive system configuration. Protection of this file is critical for system security.'
  desc 'check', 'Verify the ownership of the "/boot/grub2/grub.cfg" file with the following command:

$ sudo stat -c "%U %n" /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

root /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

If "/boot/grub2/grub.cfg" file does not have an owner of "root", this is a finding.'
  desc 'fix', 'Change the owner of the file /boot/grub2/grub.cfg to root by running the following command:

$ sudo chown root /boot/grub2/grub.cfg'
  impact 0.5
  ref 'DPMS Target Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9'
  tag check_id: 'C-61532r925358_chk'
  tag severity: 'medium'
  tag gid: 'V-257791'
  tag rid: 'SV-257791r925360_rule'
  tag stig_id: 'RHEL-09-212030'
  tag gtitle: 'SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227'
  tag fix_id: 'F-61456r925359_fix'
  tag 'documentable'
  tag cci: ['CCI-000366']
  tag nist: ['CM-6 b']
  tag 'host'

  only_if('Control not applicable within a container', impact: 0.0) {
    !virtualization.system.eql?('docker')
  }

  grubfile = input('grub_conf_path')

  describe file(grubfile) do
    it { should exist }
    it { should be_owned_by 'root' }
  end
end
```

An InSpec control includes specific keywords like `control` and `describe` that define and logically organize tests. It will likely also reference some of InSpecs [Resources](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/resources/), pre-defined classes that model parts of software systems that we want to test to make test-writing easier. This control invoked the `file` resource, which allows test writers to ask questions about the attributes of files on the filesystem.

### What happens when I run a profile?

InSpec controls can be run singularly, or more commonly in a group as an entire profile is executed against the system we want to evaluate. The tool can pass output to a variety of destinations - in simple cases, we will direct the output to the terminal's STDOUT, while if we want to save our results to a report, we can pass the report to a visualization tool such as [Heimdall](https://heimdall-lite.mitre.org). We will discuss reporting and visualizing InSpec's output in more detail later.
