## Profile Dependencies (Overlays)

In addition to its own controls, an InSpec profile can leverage controls from one or more other InSpec profiles.

When a profile depends on controls from other profiles, it can be referred to as an "overlay" or "wrapper" profile. We'll use the term overlay profile in this section.

An overlay can include all, select specific, skip some, or modify controls it uses from the profiles it is depending on.

```flow
overlay=>operation: my_nginx_overlay
e=>end: my_nginx

e->overlay
```

To recap, here are the controls that are in the `my_nginx` profile:

```ruby
control 'nginx-version' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'NGINX version'
  desc 'The required version of NGINX should be installed.'
  describe nginx do
    its('version') { should cmp >= input('nginx_version') }
  end
end

control 'nginx-modules' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'NGINX modules'
  desc 'The required NGINX modules should be installed.'
  required_modules = input('nginx_modules')
  describe nginx do
    required_modules.each do |required_module|
      its('modules') { should include required_module }
    end
  end
end

control 'nginx-conf-file' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'NGINX configuration file'
  desc 'The NGINX config file should exist.'
  describe file('/etc/nginx/nginx.conf') do
    it { should be_file }
  end
end

control 'nginx-conf-perms' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'NGINX configuration permissions'
  desc 'The NGINX config file should owned by root, be writable only by owner, and not writeable or and readable by others.'
  describe file('/etc/nginx/nginx.conf') do
    it { should be_owned_by 'root' }
    it { should be_grouped_into 'root' }
    it { should_not be_readable.by('others') }
    it { should_not be_writable.by('others') }
    it { should_not be_executable.by('others') }
  end
end

control 'nginx-shell-access' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'NGINX shell access'
  desc 'The NGINX shell access should be restricted to admin users.'
  describe users.shells(/bash/).usernames do
    it { should be_in input('admin_users')}
  end
end
```

### Creating the Overlay

#### Mini Quiz: Do you remember how to initialize a profile?

::: details How to initialize the overlay
```sh
inspec init profile my_nginx_overlay
```


The terminal output should look like the following:

```bash
Create new profile at /<pwd>/my_nginx_overlay
 * Create directory controls
 * Create file controls/example.rb
 * Create file inspec.yml
 * Create file README.md
```
:::

In this example, we will rename the `example.rb` to `overlay.rb` to avoid confusion.

```sh
tree my_nginx_overlay
```
Which should look like:
```sh
      my_nginx_overlay
      ├── README.md
      ├── controls
      │   └── overlay.rb
      └── inspec.yml

      1 directory, 3 files
```
### Defining the Profile Dependency  

For a profile to use controls from another profile, the dependency needs to be included in the `depends` section of the overlay's `inspec.yml` file. For example, you can develop `my_nginx_overlay` that uses controls from the `my_nginx` profile. In this case, the `depends` section of `inspec.yml` of `my_nginx_overlay` should list the name and location of `my_nginx`. One way of declaring the dependency is:

::: code-tabs
@tab my_nginx_overlay/inspec.yml
```yaml
name: my_nginx_overlay
# Metadata

depends:
  - name: my_nginx
    path: ../my_nginx # {path relative to the overlay}
```
:::

Once defined in the `inspec.yml` file, controls from the included profiles can be used!

::: info More dependency info
Note that a dependency definition can lead to an HTTP/S path or a .git link, just like how `inspec exec` can reference profiles that live on the network.

See the docs' [Profile Dependencies](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/profiles/#sts=Profile%20Dependencies) section for details.
:::

### Including All Controls

After defining the dependency in the `inspec.yml` of `my_nginx_overlay`, controls from `my_nginx` are available to be used in the overlay. By using `include_controls <profile>` in the `overlay.rb` of the overlay profile, all controls from the named profile will be executed every time the overlay is executed. Below you can see an example of an `overlay.rb` file in the `controls` folder of the overlay.

::: code-tabs
@tab my_nginx_overlay/controls/overlay.rb
```ruby
include_controls 'my_nginx'
```
:::

In the example above, every time `my_nginx_overlay` profile is executed, all the controls from `my_nginx` profile are also executed. Therefore, the following controls would be executed for `my_nginx_overlay`:

| Controls      |     Executed  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| nginx-version |      &check;  |
| nginx-modules |      &check;  |
| nginx-conf-file |     &check;  |
| nginx-conf-perms |    &check;  |
| nginx-shell-access |  &check;  |

### Skipping a Control

What if you don't want to run one of the controls from the included profile? Luckily, it is not necessary to maintain a slightly-modified copy of the included profile just to delete a control. The `skip_control` command tells InSpec not to run a particular control.

::: code-tabs
@tab my_nginx_overlay/controls/overlay.rb
```ruby
include_controls 'my_nginx' do
  skip_control 'nginx-conf-perms'
end
```
:::

In the above example, all controls from `my_nginx` profile will be executed, **except** for control `nginx-conf-perms`, every time `my_nginx_overlay` is executed. Therefore, the following controls will be executed for `my_nginx_overlay`:

| Controls      |     Executed  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| nginx-version |      &check;  |
| nginx-modules |      &check;  |
| nginx-conf-file |     &check;  |
| nginx-conf-perms |   &cross;   |
| nginx-shell-access |  &check;  |

### Selectively Including Controls

If there are only a handful of controls that should be executed from an included profile, it’s not necessary to skip all the unneeded controls, or worse, copy/paste those controls bit-for-bit into your profile[^first]. Instead, use the `require_controls` command.

::: code-tabs
@tab my_nginx_overlay/controls/overlay.rb
```ruby
require_controls 'my_nginx' do
  control 'nginx-version'
  control 'nginx-modules'
end
```
:::


Whenever `my_nginx_overlay` is executed, it will run only the controls from `my_nginx` that are specified in the `require_controls` block. In the case, the following controls would be executed:

| Controls      |     Executed  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| nginx-version |      &check;  |
| nginx-modules |      &check;  |
| nginx-conf-file |     &cross;  |
| nginx-conf-perms |   &cross;   |
| nginx-shell-access |  &cross;  |

Controls `nginx-conf-file`, `nginx-conf-perms`, and `nginx-shell-access` would not be executed, just as if they were manually skipped. This method of including specific controls ensures only the controls specified are executed.

::: warning
If new controls are added to a later version of `my_nginx`, they would not be executed unless explicitly required in this scenario.
:::

### Modifying a Control  

Let’s say a particular control from an included profile should still run, but the impact level set in the control isn’t appropriate. When a control is included or required, it can also be modified!

::: code-tabs
@tab include_controls
```ruby
include_controls 'my_nginx' do
  control 'nginx-modules' do
    impact 0.5
  end
end
```

@tab require_controls
```ruby
require_controls 'my_nginx' do
  control 'nginx-modules' do
    impact 0.5
  end
  control 'nginx-conf-file'
end
```

:::

In the above example, all included or required controls from `my_nginx` profile are executed. However, should control `nginx-modules` fail, it will be raised with an impact of `0.5` instead of the originally-intended impact of `1.0`.

::: note 
Any fields that you *do not* explicitly modify in an included control will not be changed from the baseline.

Therefore, you can import a control and only override a single field like the `impact` while leaving the actual control code and the rest of the metadata tags untouched.
:::

### Additional Examples

Let's poke around a few more examples of inheritance.

- [Sample Hello World Web ](https://github.com/mitre/helloworld-web-baseline)
- [Sample RHEL8 Overlay ](https://github.com/mitre/sample-rhel8-overlay)
- [Sample MySQL Overlay ](https://github.com/mitre/sample-mysql-overlay)
- [AWS RDS Oracle 19c ](https://github.com/mitre/aws-rds-oracle-database-19c-cis-baseline) (Advanced)

::: note Cloud environment overlays
MITRE SAF's [Validation library](https://saf.mitre.org/libs/validation) includes several AWS RDS overlays for common databases. Cloud environment deployment often requires an overlay to be written for the underlying technology. For example, suddenly every system has a CSP-default account (e.g. `ec2-user`).
:::

[^first]: Copying and pasting controls from a profile, instead of creating an overlay, can lead to important updates not being reflected. Overlays keep the profile changes in sync as they pull the latest updates.
