title: 3. Study an InSpec Profile - NGINX Example

## Studying an InSpec profile

Let's start by creating a profile that will contain NGINX tests.

At your terminal, type:

::: code-tabs#shell

@tab InSpec Init Command

```bash
inspec init profile my_nginx
```

@tab Expected Output

```bash
 ─────────────────────────── InSpec Code Generator ─────────────────────────── 

Creating new profile at /workspaces/saf-training-lab-environment/my_nginx
 • Creating file inspec.yml
 • Creating directory /workspaces/saf-training-lab-environment/my_nginx/controls
 • Creating file controls/example.rb
 • Creating file README.md
```
:::

### Understanding the profile structure

Let's take a look at how the profile is structured. We'll start with how a profile's files are structured and then move to what makes up an InSpec control.

First, run `tree` to see what's in the `my_nginx` profile.

::: code-tabs#shell

@tab Tree Command

```sh
tree my_nginx
```
@tab Expected Output - my_nginx folder structure
```
my_nginx
├── README.md
├── controls
│   └── example.rb
└── inspec.yml
```
:::

Here's the role of each component.

- `README.md` provides documentation about the profile, including what it covers and how to run it.
- The `controls` directory contains files which implement the InSpec tests.
- `inspec.yml` provides metadata, or information, about the profile. Metadata includes the profile's description, author, copyright, and version.
- You may optionally have a `libraries` directory. The `libraries` directory contains resource extensions. A resource extension enables you to [define your own resource types](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/dsl_resource/). The [Advanced Security Automation Developer Class](../advanced/README.md) teaches about defining your own resources.

### Understand a control's structure

Let's take a look at the default control file, `controls/example.rb`.

```ruby
title 'sample section'

# you can also use plain tests
describe file('/tmp') do
  it { should be_directory }
end

# you add controls here
control 'tmp-1.0' do                        # A unique ID for this control
  impact 0.7                                # The criticality, if this control fails.
  title 'Create /tmp directory'             # A human-readable title
  desc 'An optional description...'
  describe file('/tmp') do                  # The actual test
    it { should be_directory }
  end
end
```

::: tip Tip for developing profiles
When creating new profiles use the existing example file as a template
:::

This example shows two tests. Both tests check for the existence of the `/tmp` directory. The second test provides additional information about the test. Let's break down each component.

- `control` (line 9) is followed by the control's name. Each control in a profile has a unique name.
- `impact` (line 10) measures the relative importance of the test and must be a value between 0.0 and 1.0.
- `title` (line 11) defines the control's purpose.
- `desc` (line 12) provides a more complete description of what the control checks for.
- `describe` (lines 13 — 15) defines the test. Here, the test checks for the existence of the `/tmp` directory.

In Ruby, the `do` and `end` keywords define a `block`. An InSpec control always contains at least one `describe` block. However, a control can contain many `describe` blocks.

:::

### Understand a describe block's structure

As with many test frameworks, InSpec code resembles natural language. Here's the format of a describe block.

```ruby
describe <entity> do
  it { <expectation> }
end
```

An InSpec test has two main components: the subject to examine and the subject's expected state. Here, `<entity>` is the subject you want to examine, for example, a package name, service, file, or network port. The `<expectation>` specifies the desired result or expected state, for example, that a port should be open (or perhaps should not be open.)

Let's take a closer look at the `describe` block in the example.

```ruby
describe file('/tmp') do
  it { should be_directory }
end
```

Because InSpec resembles human-readable language, you might read this test as "/tmp should be a directory." Let's break down each component.

---

#### `file`

[file](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/resources/file/) is an InSpec [resource](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/resources/). Resources are written as Ruby classes to describe a part of the system, providing attributes that are easy to call upon within the InSpec test. For example, the InSpec file resource tests for file attributes, including a file's owner, mode, and permissions. The example examines the /tmp directory.

:::info Note
If you're familiar with Chef, you know that a resource configures one part of the system. InSpec resources are similar.
:::

---

#### `it`

The `it` statement validates one of your resource's features. A `describe` block contains one or more `it` statements. `it` enables you to test the resource itself. You'll also see `its`, which describes some feature of the resource, such as its mode or owner. You'll see examples of both `it` and `its` shortly.

:::warning it vs. its
Important! Just like in English grammar, pay attention to the difference between the thing (it) and the possessive word (its). 

`it` is used to describe an action or the expected behavior of the **subject/resource** in question.
e.g. `it { should be_owned_by 'root' }`

`its` is used to specify the expectation(s) of **an attribute of the subject/resource**.
e.g. `its("signal") { should eq "on" }`
:::

---

#### `should`

`should` describes the expectation. `should` asserts that the condition that follows _should_ be true. Alternatively, `should_not` asserts that the condition that follows _should not_ be true. You'll see examples of both shortly.

---

#### `be_directory`

`be_directory` is an example of a [matcher](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/). A matcher compares a resource's actual value to its expected value. InSpec provides several predefined matchers. The `file` resource provides the `be_directory` matcher.


### Comprehension Check!

Look at the 4 file structures below. Determine which are valid InSpec Profiles!

::: code-tabs#shell

@tab A

```sh
folder_A
├── README.md
├── controls
│   ├── example-control-1.rb
│   ├── example-control-2.rb
│   └── example-control-3.rb
└── inspec.yml

2 directories, 5 files
```

@tab B

```sh
folder_B
├── README.md
├── controls
    ├── example-control-1.rb
    ├── example-control-2.rb
    └── example-control-3.rb

2 directories, 4 files
```

@tab C
```sh
folder_C
├── README.md
├── example-control-1.rb
├── example-control-2.rb
├── example-control-3.rb
└── inspec.yml

1 directories, 5 files
```

@tab D

```sh
folder_D
├── Gemfile
├── README.md
├── controls
│   ├── example-control-1.rb
│   ├── example-control-2.rb
│   └── example-control-3.rb
├── inspec.yml
└── libraries
    └── my_resource.rb

3 directories, 7 files
```

:::

:::details Which of the folders above (A, B, C, and D) are valid InSpec profiles?
A and D are valid InSpec profiles! 

**INVALID PROFILES:**
- **B** is not a profile because it is missing the inspec.yml file!
- **C** is not a profile because it does not have a controls directory! 

**VALID PROFILES:**
- **A** is a profile! 
- **D** is a profile! A profile can have extra things like a Gemfile and a libraries folder as long as it has the controls directory and the inspec.yml file!
:::

:::tip TIP: inspec check
To see if you have a valid InSpec profile, you can run `inspec check <path-to-inspec-profile-folder>`
