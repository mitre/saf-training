## Verification

At this point we have a much more mature workflow file. We have one more activity we need to do -- verification, or checking that the output of our validation run met our expectations.

Note that "meeting our expectations" does *not* automatically mean that there are no failing tests. In many real-world use cases, security tests fail, but the software is still considered worth the risk to deploy because of mitigations for that risk, or perhaps the requirement is inapplicable due to the details of the deployment. With that said, we still want to run our tests to make sure we are continually collecting data; we just don't want our pipeline to halt if it finds a test that we were always expecting to fail.

By default, the InSpec executable returns a code 100 if *any* tests in a profile run fail. Pipeline orchestrators, like most software, interpret any non-zero return code as a serious failure, and will halt the pipeline run accordingly unless we explicitly tell it to ignore errors. This is why the "VALIDATE - Run InSpec" step has the `continue-on-error: true ` attribute specified.

Our goal is to complete our InSpec scan, collect the result as a report file, and then parse that file to determine if we met our own *threshold* of security. We can do this with the SAF CLI.

### The SAF CLI

The [SAF CLI](https://saf-cli.mitre.org/) is one the tool that the SAF supports to help automate security validation. It is our "kitchen-sink" utility for pipelines. If you took the [SAF User Class](../user/README.md), you are already familiar with the SAF CLI's [attestation](../user/12.md) function. 

This tool was installed alongside InSpec when you ran the `./build-lab.sh` script. For general installation instructions, see the first link in the above paragraph.

#### SAF CLI Capabilities

Some SAF CLI capabilities are listed in this diagram, but you can see all of them on the [SAF CLI documentation](https://saf-cli.mitre.org/).

In addition to the documentation site, you can view the SAF CLI's capabilities by running:

### Updating the Workflow File

Let's add two steps to our pipeline to use the SAF CLI to understand our InSpec scan results before we verify them against a threshold. 

::: code-tabs#shell
@tab Adding Verify Steps
``` yaml
- name: VERIFY - Display our results summary 
  uses: mitre/saf_action@v1

    command_string: "view summary -i results/pipeline_run.json"

- name: VERIFY - Ensure the scan meets our results threshold
  uses: mitre/saf_action@v1             # check if the pipeline passes our defined threshold
  with:

      - name: VERIFY - Ensure the scan meets our results threshold
        uses: mitre/saf_action@v1             # check if the pipeline passes our defined threshold
        with:
          command_string: "validate threshold -i results/pipeline_run.json -F threshold.yml"
```
:::

A few things to note here:
- Both steps are using the [SAF CLI GitHub Action](https://github.com/mitre/saf_action). This way, we don't need to install it directly on the runner; we can just pass in the command string.
- We added the `summary` step because it will print us a concise summary inside the pipeline job view itself. That command takes one file argument; the results file we want to summarize.
- The `validate threshold` command, however, needs two files -- one is our report file as usual, and the other is a **threshold file**. 

#### Threshold Files

Threshold files are what we use to define what "passing" means for our pipeline, since like we said earlier, it's more complicated than failing the pipeline on a failed test.

Consider the following sample threshold file:

```yaml
# threshold.yml file
compliance:
  min: 80
passed:
  total:
    min: 1
failed:
  total:
    max: 2
```

This file specifies that we require a *minimum of 80% of the tests to pass.* We also specify that *at least one of them should pass, and that at maximum two of them can fail.*

::: info Threshold Files Options
To make more specific or detailed thresholds, check out [this documentation on generating theshold files](https://github.com/mitre/saf/wiki/Validation-with-Thresholds).

*NOTE: You can name the threshold file something else or put it in a different location. We specify the name and location only for convenience.* 
:::

This is a sample pipeline, so we are not too worried about being very stringent. For now, let's settle for running the pipeline with no *errors* (that is, as long as each test runs, we do not care if it passed or failed, but a source code error should still fail the pipeline).

Create a new file called `threshold.yml` in the main directory to specify the threshold for acceptable test results:

``` yaml
error:
  total:
    max: 0
```

::: note How could we change this threshold file to ensure that the pipeline run will fail?
:::

And with that, we have a complete pipeline file. Let's commit our changes and see what happens.

Let's hop back to our browser and take a look at the output:

![The Completed Pipeline Run](../../assets/img/the_completed_pipeline_run.png)

There we go! All validation tests passed!

Note in the SAF CLI Summary step, we get a simple YAML output summary of the InSpec scan:

![The Summary](../../assets/img/summary_data.png)

We see five critical tests (remember how we set them all to `impact 1.0`?) passing, and no failures:
``` yaml
- profileName: my_nginx
  resultSets:
    - pipeline_run.json
  compliance: 100
  passed:
    critical: 5
    high: 0
    medium: 0
    low: 0
    total: 5
  failed:
    critical: 0
    high: 0
    medium: 0
    low: 0
    total: 0
  skipped:
    critical: 0
    high: 0
    medium: 0
    low: 0
    total: 0
  error:
    critical: 0
    high: 0
    medium: 0
    low: 0
    total: 0
  no_impact:
    none: 0
    total: 0
```

Note also that our test report is avaiable as an artifact from the overall pipeline run summary view now:

![The Artifact](../../assets/img/the_completed_pipeline_run.png)

From here, we can download that file and drop it off in somehting like Heimdall or feed into some other security process at our leisure (or we can add a pipeline step to do that for us!).

In a real use case, if our pipeline passed, we would next save our bonafide hardened image to a secure registry where it could be distributed to developers. If the pipeline did not pass, we would have already collected data describing why, in the form of InSpec scan reports that we save as artifacts.
