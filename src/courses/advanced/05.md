title: 5. Create a Custom Resource - The Git Example
author: Aaron Lippold
headerDepth: 3
---

Let's practice creating our own custom resource. Let's say we want to write tests that examine the current state of a local Git repository. We want to create a `git` resource to handle all of InSpec's interactions with the Git repo under the hood, so that we can focus on writing clean and easy-to-read profile code.

Let's take a look at this InSpec video that walks through this example and then try it out ourselves.

<style>
.video-container {
    position: relative;
    padding-bottom: 56.25%; /* 16:9 */
    height: 0;
}
.video-container iframe {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
}
</style>
<div class="video-container">
  <iframe width="1028" height="578" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xka2xT6Cngg?list=PLSZbtIlMt5rcbXOpMRucKzRMXR7HX7awy" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Create new InSpec profile
Let's start by creating a new profile:

::: code-tabs

@tab Command
```bash
inspec init profile git
```
@tab Output
```bash
 ─────────────────────────── InSpec Code Generator ─────────────────────────── 

Creating new profile at /workspaces/saf-training-lab-environment/git
 • Creating file inspec.yml
 • Creating directory /workspaces/saf-training-lab-environment/git/controls
 • Creating file controls/example.rb
 • Creating file README.md
```
:::

### Develop controls to test / run profile

To write tests, we first need to know and have what we are testing! In your Codespaces environment, there is a git repository that we will test under the `resources` folder. The git repository will be the test target, similarly to how the docker containers acted as test targets in previous sections. Unzip the target git repository using the following command:

```sh
unzip ./resources/git_test.zip 
```

This will generate a `git_test` repository which we will use for these examples.

Now let's write some controls and test that they run. You can put these controls in the `example.rb` file generated in the `controls` folder of your `git` InSpec profile. These controls are written using the `command` resource which is provided by InSpec. We will write a `git` resource in this section to improve this test. **Note that you will need to put the full directory path of the `.git` file from your `git_test` repository as the `git_dir` value on line 4 of `example.rb`. To get the full path of your current location in the terminal, use `pwd`.**
```ruby
# encoding: utf-8
# copyright: 2018, The Authors

git_dir = "/workspaces/saf-training-lab-environment/git_test/.git"

# The following banches should exist
describe command("git --git-dir #{git_dir} branch") do
  its('stdout') { should match /master/ }
end

describe command("git --git-dir #{git_dir} branch") do
  its('stdout') { should match /testBranch/ }
end

# What is the current branch
describe command("git --git-dir #{git_dir} branch") do
  its('stdout') { should match /^\* master/ }
end

# What is the latest commit
describe command("git --git-dir #{git_dir} log -1 --pretty=format:'%h'") do
  its('stdout') { should match /edc207f/ }
end

# What is the second to last commit
describe command("git --git-dir #{git_dir} log --skip=1 -1 --pretty=format:'%h'") do
  its('stdout') { should match /8c30bff/ }
end
```

::: code-tabs

Run the profile.
@tab Command
```bash
inspec exec git
```

@tab Output
```bash

     ✔  stdout is expected to match /8c30bff/

Test Summary: 5 successful, 0 failures, 0 skipped
```
:::

Our tests pass, but they all use the `command` resource. It's not best practice to do this -- for one thing, it makes our tests more complicated, and the output too long.

::: warning But What If I Don't Care About The Tests Being Complicated And The Output Being Too Long?
Some test writers like to wrap their favorite bash commands in a `command` block and call it a day.
 However, best practice is to write clean and maintainable InSpec code even if you yourself have no trouble using the `command` resource to do everything. 

Recall that other developers and assessors need to be able to understand how your tests function. Nobody likes trying to debug someone else's profile that assumes that the operator knows exactly how the profile writer's favorite terminal commands work.
:::

Let's rewrite these tests in a way that abstracts away the complexity of working with the `git` command into a resource.

###  Rewrite test
Let's rewrite the first test in our example file to make it more readable with a `git` resource as follows:
```ruby
# The following banches should exist
describe git(git_dir) do
  its('branches') { should include 'master' }
end
```
Now let's run the profile.

::: code-tabs

@tab Command
```bash
inspec exec git
```
@tab Output
```bash
[2023-02-22T03:21:41+00:00] ERROR: Failed to load profile git: Failed to load source for controls/example.rb: undefined method `git' for #<Inspec::ControlEvalContext:0x000000000540af38>

```
:::

We should get an error because the git method and resource are not defined yet. We should fix that.

### Develop the git resource

Let's start by creating a new file called `git.rb` in the `libraries` directory. If you do not already have a `libraries` directory, you can make one in the `git` InSpec profile directory. The content of the file should look like this:
```ruby
# encoding: utf-8
# copyright: 2019, The Authors

class Git < Inspec.resource(1)
    name 'git'

end
```

:::tip Setting Up a Resource Using InSpec Init
Instead of just creating the `git.rb` file in the `libraries` directory, you can use InSpec to assist you in creating a resource. Run `inspec init resource <your-resource-name>` and follow the prompts to create the foundation and see examples for a resource.
:::

Now run the profile again.
::: code-tabs

@tab Command
```bash
inspec exec git
```
@tab Output
```bash
[2023-02-22T03:25:57+00:00] ERROR: Failed to load profile git: Failed to load source for controls/example.rb: wrong number of arguments (given 1, expected 0)

```
:::

This time we get another error letting us know that we have a resource that has been given the incorrect number of arguments. This means we have given an additional parameter to this resource that we have not yet accepted.

Each resource will require an initialization method.

For our git.rb file let's add that initialization method:
```ruby
# encoding: utf-8
# copyright: 2019, The Authors

class Git < Inspec.resource(1)
    name 'git'

    def initialize(path)
        @path = path
    end

end
```
This is saving the path we are passing in from the control into an instance method called `path`.

Now when we run the profile.

::: code-tabs

@tab Command
```bash
inspec exec git
```
@tab Output
```bash
Profile:   InSpec Profile (git)

  git

     ✔  stdout is expected to match /testBranch/
  Command: `git --git-dir /workspaces/saf-training-lab-environment/git_test/.git branch`
     ✔  stdout is expected to match /^\* master/

     ✔  stdout is expected to match /edc207f/
  Command: `git --git-dir /workspaces/saf-training-lab-environment/git_test/.git log --skip=1 -1 --pretty=format:'%h'`
     ✔  stdout is expected to match /8c30bff/

Test Summary: 4 successful, 1 failure, 0 skipped
```
:::

The test will run but we will get an error saying we do not have a `branches` method. Remember that the other 4 tests are still passing because they are not yet using the `git` resource, but are still relying on InSpec's `command` resource.

Let's go back to our git.rb file to fix that by adding a `branches` method:
```ruby
# encoding: utf-8
# copyright: 2019, The Authors

class Git < Inspec.resource(1)
    name 'git'

    def initialize(path)
        @path = path
    end

    def branches

    end

end
```

We have now defined the branches method. Let's see what the test output shows us.

::: code-tabs

@tab Command
```bash
inspec exec git
```
@tab Output
```bash
Profile:   InSpec Profile (git)
Version:   0.1.0
Target:    local://
Target ID: 6dcb9e6f-5ede-5474-9521-595fadf5c7ce

  git
     ×  branches is expected to include "master"
     expected nil to include "master", but it does not respond to `include?`
  Command: `git --git-dir /workspaces/saf-training-lab-environment/git_test/.git branch`
     ✔  stdout is expected to match /testBranch/
  Command: `git --git-dir /workspaces/saf-training-lab-environment/git_test/.git branch`
     ✔  stdout is expected to match /^\* master/
  Command: `git --git-dir /workspaces/saf-training-lab-environment/git_test/.git log -1 --pretty=format:'%h'`
     ✔  stdout is expected to match /edc207f/
  Command: `git --git-dir /workspaces/saf-training-lab-environment/git_test/.git log --skip=1 -1 --pretty=format:'%h'`
     ✔  stdout is expected to match /8c30bff/

Test Summary: 4 successful, 1 failure, 0 skipped
```
:::

Now the error message says that the `branches` method is returning a null value when it's expecting an array or something that is able to accept the include method invoked on it.

We can use the InSpec helper method which enables you to invoke any other inspec resource as seen below:
```ruby
# encoding: utf-8
# copyright: 2019, The Authors

class Git < Inspec.resource(1)
    name 'git'

    def initialize(path)
        @path = path
    end

    def branches
        inspec.command("git --git-dir #{@path} branch").stdout
    end

end
```
We have borrowed the built-in `command` resource to handle running Git's CLI commands.

Now we see that we get a passing test!

Now let's adjust our test to also check for our second branch that we created earlier as well as check our current branch:
```ruby
# The following banches should exist
describe git(git_dir) do
  its('branches') { should include 'master' }
  its('branches') { should include 'testBranch' }
  its('current_branch') { should cmp 'master' }
end
```

::: code-tabs

@tab Command
```bash
inspec exec git
```
@tab Output
```bash
Profile:   InSpec Profile (git)

  git
     ✔  branches is expected to include "master"
     ✔  branches is expected to include "testBranch"
     ×  current_branch 
     undefined method `current_branch' for #<#<Class:0x0000000005400588>:0x00000000053fd0b8>

     ✔  stdout is expected to match /8c30bff/

Test Summary: 6 successful, 1 failure, 0 skipped
```
:::

Let's head over to the git.rb file to create the `current_branch` method we are invoking in the above test:
```ruby
# encoding: utf-8
# copyright: 2019, The Authors

class Git < Inspec.resource(1)
    name 'git'

    def initialize(path)
        @path = path
    end

    def branches
        inspec.command("git --git-dir #{@path} branch").stdout
    end

    def current_branch
        branch_name = inspec.command("git --git-dir #{@path} branch").stdout.strip.split("\n").find do |name|
            name.start_with?('*')
        end
        branch_name.gsub(/^\*/,'').strip
    end

end
```

Now we can run the profile again.

::: code-tabs

@tab Command
```bash
inspec exec git
```

@tab Output
