title: 5. Create a Custom Resource - The Git Example
author: Aaron Lippold
headerDepth: 3
---

Let's practice creating our own custom resource. Suppose we want to write tests that examine the current state of a local Git repository. We will create a `git` resource that can handle all of InSpec's interactions with a Git repo under the hood, allowing us to focus on writing clean and easy-to-read code within a control.

### Create a New InSpec Profile

Let's start by creating a new profile:

::: code-tabs

@tab Command

```bash
inspec init profile git
```

@tab Output

```bash
 ─────────────────────────── InSpec Code Generator ─────────────────────────── 

Creating new profile at /workspaces/saf-training-lab-environment/git
 • Creating file inspec.yml
 • Creating directory /workspaces/saf-training-lab-environment/git/controls
 • Creating file controls/example.rb
 • Creating file README.md
```

:::

### Develop Example Use-case Tests

To write resources, we first need to know what we are testing! In your Codespaces environment, there is a git repository that we will test under the `resources` folder. The git repository will be the test target, similarly to how the docker containers acted as test targets in previous sections. Unzip the target git repository using the following command:

```sh
unzip ./resources/git_test.zip 
```

This will generate a `git_test` repository which we will use for these examples.

Now let's write some tests and confirm that they run. You can put these tests in the `example.rb` file generated in the `controls` folder of your `git` InSpec profile. These tests are written using the `command` resource which is provided by InSpec. We will write a `git` resource in this section to improve this test. **Note that you will need to put the full directory path of the `.git` file from your `git_test` repository as the `git_dir` value on line 4 of `example.rb`. To get the full path of your current location in the terminal, use `pwd`.**

```ruby
# encoding: utf-8
# copyright: 2018, The Authors

git_dir = "/workspaces/saf-training-lab-environment/git_test/.git"

# The following banches should exist
describe command("git --git-dir #{git_dir} branch") do
  its('stdout') { should match /main/ }
end

describe command("git --git-dir #{git_dir} branch") do
  its('stdout') { should match /testBranch/ }
end

# What is the current branch
describe command("git --git-dir #{git_dir} branch") do
  its('stdout') { should match /^\* main/ }
end

# What is the latest commit
describe command("git --git-dir #{git_dir} log -1 --pretty=format:'%h'") do
  its('stdout') { should match /edc207f/ }
end

# What is the second to last commit
describe command("git --git-dir #{git_dir} log --skip=1 -1 --pretty=format:'%h'") do
  its('stdout') { should match /8c30bff/ }
end
```

::: code-tabs

Run the profile.
@tab Command

```bash
inspec exec git
```

@tab Output

```bash

     ✔  stdout is expected to match /8c30bff/

Test Summary: 5 successful, 0 failures, 0 skipped
```

:::

Our tests pass, but they all use the `command` resource. It's not best practice to do this -- for one thing, it makes our tests more complicated, and the output too long.

::: warning But What If I Don't Care About The Tests Being Complicated And The Output Being Too Long?
Some test writers like to wrap their favorite bash commands in a `command` block and call it a day.
 However, best practice is to write clean and maintainable InSpec code even if you yourself have no trouble using the `command` resource to do everything.

Recall that other developers and assessors need to be able to understand how your tests function. Nobody likes trying to debug someone else's profile that assumes that the operator knows exactly how the profile writer's favorite terminal commands work.
:::

Let's rewrite these tests in a way that abstracts away the complexity of working with the `git` command into a resource.

### Rewrite a Test

Let's rewrite the first test in our example file to make it more readable by inventing a `git` resource that can simplify our test as follows:

```ruby
# The following banches should exist
describe git(git_dir) do
  its('branches') { should include 'main' }
end
```

Now let's run the profile.

::: code-tabs

@tab Command

```bash
inspec exec git
```

@tab Output

```bash
[2023-02-22T03:21:41+00:00] ERROR: Failed to load profile git: Failed to load source for controls/example.rb: undefined method `git' for #<Inspec::ControlEvalContext:0x000000000540af38>

```

:::

We should get an error because the git method and resource are not defined yet. We should fix that.

### Develop the git resource

Let's start by creating a new file called `git.rb` in the `libraries` directory. If you do not already have a `libraries` directory, you can make one in the `git` InSpec profile directory. The content of the file should look like this:

```ruby
# encoding: utf-8
# copyright: 2019, The Authors

class Git < Inspec.resource(1)
    name 'git'
end
```

This is - technically - a valid resource! It was very easy to write, but it is not particularly useful for testing. Let's run our tests again to see why not.

:::tip Setting Up a Resource Using InSpec Init
Instead of just creating the `git.rb` file in the `libraries` directory, you can use InSpec to assist you in creating a resource. Run `inspec init resource <your-resource-name>` and follow the prompts to create the foundation and see examples for a resource.
:::

Run the profile again.
::: code-tabs

@tab Command

```bash
inspec exec git
```

@tab Output

```bash
[2023-02-22T03:25:57+00:00] ERROR: Failed to load profile git: Failed to load source for controls/example.rb: wrong number of arguments (given 1, expected 0)

```

:::

This time we get another error letting us know that we have a resource that has been given the incorrect number of arguments. This means we have given an additional parameter to this resource that we have not yet accepted.

Each resource will require an initialization method.

For our git.rb file let's add that initialization method:

```ruby
# encoding: utf-8
# copyright: 2019, The Authors

class Git < Inspec.resource(1)
    name 'git'

    def initialize(path)
        @path = path
    end

end
```

This is saving the path we are passing in from the control into an instance method called `path`.

Now when we run the profile:

::: code-tabs

@tab Command

```bash
inspec exec git
```

@tab Output

```bash
Profile:   InSpec Profile (git)

  Command: `git --git-dir /workspaces/saf-training-lab-environment/git_test/.git branch`
     ✔  stdout is expected to match /^\* main/

     ✔  stdout is expected to match /edc207f/
  Command: `git --git-dir /workspaces/saf-training-lab-environment/git_test/.git log --skip=1 -1 --pretty=format:'%h'`
     ✔  stdout is expected to match /8c30bff/

Test Summary: 4 successful, 1 failure, 0 skipped
```

:::

The test will run but we will get an error saying we do not have a `branches` method. Remember that the other 4 tests are still passing because they are not yet using the `git` resource, but are still relying on InSpec's `command` resource.

Let's go back to our git.rb file to fix that by adding a `branches` method:

```ruby
# encoding: utf-8
# copyright: 2019, The Authors

class Git < Inspec.resource(1)
    name 'git'

    def initialize(path)
        @path = path
    end

    def branches

    end

end
```

We have now defined the branches method. Let's see what the test output shows us.

::: code-tabs

@tab Command

```bash
inspec exec git
```

@tab Output

```bash
Profile:   InSpec Profile (git)
Version:   0.1.0
Target:    local://
Target ID: 6dcb9e6f-5ede-5474-9521-595fadf5c7ce

  git
     ×  branches is expected to include "main"
     expected nil to include "main", but it does not respond to `include?`
  Command: `git --git-dir /workspaces/saf-training-lab-environment/git_test/.git branch`
     ✔  stdout is expected to match /testBranch/
  Command: `git --git-dir /workspaces/saf-training-lab-environment/git_test/.git branch`
     ✔  stdout is expected to match /^\* main/
  Command: `git --git-dir /workspaces/saf-training-lab-environment/git_test/.git log -1 --pretty=format:'%h'`
     ✔  stdout is expected to match /edc207f/
  Command: `git --git-dir /workspaces/saf-training-lab-environment/git_test/.git log --skip=1 -1 --pretty=format:'%h'`
     ✔  stdout is expected to match /8c30bff/

Test Summary: 4 successful, 1 failure, 0 skipped
```

:::

Now the error message says that the `branches` method is returning a null value which is a problem because it actually needs to return something, like an array, that implements the predicate method `include?`.  A predicate method is one that evaluates a condition, in this case whether a given branch is "included" in the set of branches, and returns true or false accordingly.

To resolve this problem, we can use the `inspec` helper method to invoke the built-in `command` resource to extract this data as shown below:

```ruby
# encoding: utf-8
# copyright: 2019, The Authors

class Git < Inspec.resource(1)
    name 'git'

    def initialize(path)
        @path = path
    end

    def branches
        inspec.command("git --git-dir #{@path} branch").stdout
    end

end
```

You might notice some similarities between this code and what we originally started with in our `example.rb` file - this is intentional!  Resources are used to encapsulate complicated behaviors, such as the mechanics of dealing with niche `git` subcommands, and expose clean interfaces for use by control authors.

Now we see that we get a passing test!

Now let's adjust our test to also check for our second branch that we created earlier as well as check our current branch:

```ruby
# The following banches should exist
describe git(git_dir) do
  its('branches') { should include 'main' }
  its('branches') { should include 'testBranch' }
  its('current_branch') { should cmp 'main' }
end
```

::: code-tabs

@tab Command

```bash
inspec exec git
```

@tab Output

```bash
Profile:   InSpec Profile (git)
Version:   0.1.0
Target:    local://
Target ID: 6dcb9e6f-5ede-5474-9521-595fadf5c7ce

  git
     ✔  branches is expected to include "main"
     ✔  branches is expected to include "testBranch"
     ×  current_branch 
     undefined method `current_branch' for #<#<Class:0x0000000005400588>:0x00000000053fd0b8>

     ✔  stdout is expected to match /edc207f/
  Command: `git --git-dir /workspaces/saf-training-lab-environment/git_test/.git log --skip=1 -1 --pretty=format:'%h'`
     ✔  stdout is expected to match /8c30bff/

Test Summary: 6 successful, 1 failure, 0 skipped
```

:::

Let's head over to the git.rb file to create the `current_branch` method we are invoking in the above test:

```ruby
# encoding: utf-8
# copyright: 2019, The Authors

class Git < Inspec.resource(1)
    name 'git'

    def initialize(path)
        @path = path
    end

    def branches
        inspec.command("git --git-dir #{@path} branch").stdout
    end

    def current_branch
        branch_name = inspec.command("git --git-dir #{@path} branch").stdout.strip.split("\n").find do |name|
            name.start_with?('*')
        end
        branch_name.gsub(/^\*/,'').strip
    end

end
```

Now we can run the profile again.

::: code-tabs

@tab Command

```bash
inspec exec git
```

@tab Output

```bash

All the tests should pass!

::: tip Exercise!
As a solo exercise, try to create a method in the git.rb file to check what the last commit is.
:::

::: important This is Test-Driven Development!
Did you notice the overall arc of how we wrote this resource? We started with a set of tests before we even wrote any resource code, so we _knew_ we would start out with a failing profile.

However, that failing profile helped us define how we should build our resource. Since we knew what sort of tests we wanted to be able to run, we knew what functions we needed to write to support them in the `git` resource. Test-driven development is an excellent method of defining requirements for your code before you even start writing it!
:::

## Run the InSpec shell with a custom resource

Invoking the InSpec shell with `inspec shell` will give you access to all the core InSpec resources by default, but InSpec does not automatically know about your locally defined resources unless you point them out. If you're testing a local resource, use the `--depends` flag and pass in the profile directory that your resource lives in.

::: code-tabs

@tab Command
```sh
inspec shell --depends git
```
@tab Output
```sh
Welcome to the interactive InSpec Shell
To find out how to use it, type: help

You are currently running on:

    Name:      ubuntu
    Families:  debian, linux, unix, os
    Release:   20.04
    Arch:      x86_64

inspec> git('/workspaces/saf-training-lab-environment/git_test/.git').current_branch
=> "main"
```

:::

::: warning
Note that we are passing in the _profile_ directory to the `--depends` flag, and not the profile's `libraries` directory. In our example, it's
``` sh
inspec shell --depends git
```
and not
``` sh
inspec shell --depends git/libraries
```
:::

If you edit the resource class file, you'll need to exit the shell and re-launch it for the updates to be available.

From here, we can examine our custom resource in a sandbox in the same way that we do with core resources.
