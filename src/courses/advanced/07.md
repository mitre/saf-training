In this exercise, you will practice writing your own resources and consider how you could implement them in a profile.

**Suggested Simple Resources to Start With:**

- **Docker**
  - `id`: Retrieves the container ID.
  - `image`: Retrieves the image name.
  - `repo`: Retrieves the repository name.
  - `tag`: Retrieves the tag.
  - `ports`: Retrieves the ports.
  - `command`: Retrieves the command.

- **Git**
  - `branches`: Checks if a branch exists.
  - `current_branch`: Retrieves the current branch.
  - `last_commit`: Retrieves the last commit from the log.
  - `git_log`: Retrieves the log of all commits.
  - `tag`: Retrieves the tag for the repository.

**Suggested Medium Complexity Resources to Start With:**

- **File Resource**
  - `owner`: Tests if the owner of the file matches the specified value.
  - `group`: Tests if the group to which a file belongs matches the specified value.
  - `size`: Tests if a file’s size matches, is greater than, or is less than the specified value.
  - `contents`: Tests if contents in the file match the value specified in a regular expression.
  - `path`: Retrieves the path to the file.

- **Directory Resource**
  - `owner`: Tests if the owner of the directory matches the specified value.
  - `group`: Tests if the group to which a directory belongs matches the specified value.
  - `size`: Tests if a directory’s size matches, is greater than, or is less than the specified value.
  - `contents`: Tests if contents in the directory match the value specified in a regular expression.
  - `path`: Retrieves the path to the directory.

- **Users**
  - `exist`: Tests if the named user exists.
  - `gid`: Tests the group identifier.
  - `group`: Tests the group to which the user belongs.
  - `groups`: Tests if the user belongs to two (or more) groups.
  - `home`: Tests the home directory path for the user.
  - `maxdays`: Tests the maximum number of days between password changes.
  - `mindays`: Tests the minimum number of days between password changes.
  - `shell`: Tests the path to the default shell for the user.
  - `uid`: Tests the user identifier.
  - `warndays`: Tests the number of days a user is warned before a password must be changed.

- **etc/hosts.allow and etc/hosts.deny**
  - `daemon`: Returns a string containing the daemon that is allowed in the rule.
  - `client_list`: Returns a 2D string array where each entry contains the clients specified for the rule.
  - `options`: Returns a 2D string array where each entry contains any options specified for the rule.

**Suggested Hard Resources to Start With:**

- **etc/shadow**
  - `users`: A list of strings representing the usernames matched by the filter.
  - `passwords`: A list of strings representing the encrypted password strings for entries matched by the filter. Each string may not be an encrypted password but rather a `*` or similar, indicating that direct logins are not allowed.
  - `last_changes`: A list of integers indicating the number of days since Jan 1, 1970, since the password for each matching entry was changed.
  - `min_days`: A list of integers reflecting the minimum number of days a password must exist before it may be changed for the users that matched the filter.
  - `max_days`: A list of integers reflecting the maximum number of days after which the password must be changed for each user matching the filter.
  - `warn_days`: A list of integers reflecting the number of days a user is warned about an expiring password for each user matching the filter.
  - `inactive_days`: A list of integers reflecting the number of days a user must be inactive before the user account is disabled for each user matching the filter.
  - `expiry_dates`: A list of integers reflecting the number of days since Jan 1, 1970, that a user account has been disabled for each user matching the filter. The value is `nil` if the account has not expired.
  - `count`: Tests the number of records that the filter matched.

- **etc/fstab**
  - `device_name`: The name associated with the device.
  - `mount_point`: The directory at which the file system is configured to be mounted.
  - `file_system_type`: The type of file system of the device or partition.
  - `mount_options`: The options for the device or partition.
  - `dump_options`: A number used by dump to decide if a file system should be backed up.
  - `file_system_options`: A number that specifies the order the file system should be checked.

- **Tomcat Server Configuration Reader**
  - `parse_conf`: Parses the configuration file.
  - `fetch_connectors`: Retrieves keys such as `port`, `protocol`, `timeout`, `redirect`, `sslprotocol`, `scheme`, `sslenable`, `clientauth`, and `secure`.
