## Learning Objectives

- Understand what constitutes a Major Version Update and why they occur
- Master the requirement alignment process using multiple identification methods
- Learn to use available tools for version transition
- Develop strategies for efficient code migration
- Implement best practices for version control and testing

## What is a Major Version Update?

A Major Version Update occurs when transitioning to a new STIG Benchmark version that introduces a completely new Rule ID index. Unlike minor Release Updates, this process requires careful mapping between old and new requirements.

## Key Concepts

### Requirement Alignment

:::tip Create a spreadsheet to track your requirement mappings during the alignment process.
:::

When moving between major versions (e.g., RHEL 8 v1R12 to RHEL 9 V1R1), we need to align existing tests with new requirements using:

- SRG IDs (Security Requirements Guide IDs)
- CCIs (Control Correlation Identifiers)
- Titles and descriptions when necessary

### The Alignment Process

1. **Initial Analysis**
   - Compare old and new benchmark requirements
   - Identify matching controls using common identifiers
   - Note any split or merged requirements

2. **Using Available Tools**
   - MITRE Vulcan assists in alignment process
   - Current Delta tool requires manual verification
   - Future automation improvements are in development

3. **Code Migration**
   - Transfer InSpec/Ruby code to new requirement locations
   - Verify control mappings
   - Update test code as needed

### Practical Example

Consider this alignment scenario where we are updating from RHEL8 to RHEL9.

The requirements are the same: the `/var/log/messages` file must be owned by root.  However, despite being the same, each requirement has its own id.  Consequently, we need to use alternative means to realize that these requirements are aligned.

Attributes to consider:
 - The title is almost the same aside from the operating system version.
 - The description is almost exactly the same aside from inconsequential differences.
   - Whitespace
   - Version number
   - Capitalization
 - Other alignment IDs are the same.
   - SRG ID / `gtitle`: SRG-OS-000206-GPOS-00084
   - CCI: CCI-001314
   - NIST: SI-11 b
 - Check and fix text
   - Fix text is the same
   - Check text specifies a different method to do the assessment, but they're functionally equivalent

::: tip Different yet the same
Even though the check text changed, it doesn't mean that the InSpec code needs to as well!  We are still correctly assessing that the `/var/log/messages` file is owned by root if it exists.

## Best Practices

- Document all requirement mappings
- Verify control alignments thoroughly
- Test extensively after migration

## What's Next

After alignment is complete, follow the standard Release Update process for:

- Setting up CI/CD
- Organizing controls
- Updating and testing requirements

## Summary

Major Version Updates require careful attention to requirement alignment and code migration. While tools like Vulcan help, some manual verification is still needed. Future improvements will streamline this process.
