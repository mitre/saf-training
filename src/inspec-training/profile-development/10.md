## Introduction to Profile Management

Security benchmark profiles are critical tools for maintaining system security standards. Before diving into the implementation details, let's understand the fundamental principles that guide their management.

## Core Principles of Profile Management

### 1. Version Control and Integrity

**Key Rule: Keep Versions Separate**

- Never mix requirements from different versions
- Each version represents a distinct security baseline
- Example: Don't combine STIG v2.5 requirements with v3.0 requirements

### 2. Completeness Principle

**Key Rule: All or Nothing**

- Security benchmarks must include all requirements for a specific version
- Think of it like a recipe - missing ingredients affect the final result
- Focus on one requirement at a time during development
- Example: A Windows 10 STIG profile must implement all controls specified in that version

### 3. Release Management

**Key Rule: Meet All Standards**

- Release readiness is determined by:
  - Passing all validation tests
  - Meeting security hardening requirements
  - Achieving expected thresholds

### 4. Testing Environment Standards

**Key Rule: Use Standard Baselines**

- Start with vendor-managed standard releases
- Test against both:
  - Default ("vanilla") configurations
  - Hardened configurations
- This ensures real-world applicability

## Best Practices for Implementation

1. Document your testing environment
2. Maintain a changelog for each profile version
3. Use version control for tracking changes
4. Test thoroughly before releasing

## Summary

Remember: Security benchmarks are complete sets of requirements tied to specific versions. Success comes from methodical implementation and thorough testing against standard baselines.
