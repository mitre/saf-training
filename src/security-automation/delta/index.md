## What Is the Delta Process?

When security guidance is updated (such as a new STIG version release), InSpec profiles need to be updated to match the new requirements. Manually updating profiles is:
- ⏱️ Time-consuming (reviewing 200+ controls one by one)
- 🐛 Error-prone (easy to miss changes or introduce mistakes)
- 😓 Tedious (repetitive metadata updates)

**The SAF delta process automates this update**, handling:
- ✅ Renamed controls (ID changed between versions)
- ✅ New controls (added in new guidance)
- ✅ Removed controls (deprecated in new guidance)
- ✅ Metadata updates (severity, descriptions, check/fix procedures)
- ✅ Preserving your test code (the Ruby describe blocks you wrote)

**Result**: What previously took days now takes minutes, with detailed reports of all changes.
