## 2.1 Key Terminology

Before we dive in, let's clarify some important terms:

::: info Understanding Delta Terminology
- **XCCDF File**: The XML file containing security guidance (downloaded from DISA or CIS)
- **Baseline**: A specific version/release of guidance (e.g., "RHEL 8 V2R1", "Windows Server 2019 V1R3")
- **InSpec Profile**: The Ruby code that tests baseline requirements
- **InSpec Profile Summary**: A JSON file (`profile.json`) containing metadata about your profile - generated with `inspec json` command
- **Delta Process**: The automation that updates your InSpec profile from old baseline → new baseline

**Example**: Updating your RHEL 8 profile from V1R14 (old baseline) to V2R1 (new baseline)

## 2.2 Requirements

To run the delta process, we need the following items:

1. An existing InSpec profile:
   a. Clone or download the profile repository to your local environment
   b. See [What is an InSpec Profile](../beginner/02.md#what-is-an-inspec-profile) for additional information

2. A new guidance file (XCCDF):
   a. Download the updated DISA STIG Benchmark or CIS Benchmark from [public.cyber.mil/stigs/downloads](https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/downloads/)

::: details What if there is no existing InSpec profile?
If the InSpec profile for your target of interest does not exist, you can generate the profile stub from the `saf generate inspec_profile` command to create a skeleton profile structure based on the XCCDF benchmark guidance (STIG or CIS). This ensures consistency across profiles.

For more information on this command, refer to the documentation for [`inspec_profile`](https://saf-cli.mitre.org/#inspec-profile).

This command is similar to the Chef InSpec [Initialize a new profile](../../inspec-training/beginner/03.md#creating-the-profile), but it uses the XCCDF content to configure (generate) the profile controls metadata and [supporting structure](../../inspec-training/beginner/02.md#the-structure-of-an-inspec-profile).
