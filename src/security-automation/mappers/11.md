title: 11. Creating a Mapping
author: Charles Hu, Ryan Lin

## Mapping Introduction

::: info Security Tool Type
This walkthrough is targeted at converting security scans to OHDF. If your security tool provides exports that are not security scans or are APIs, contact the SAF team for further instruction on how to develop those services into an OHDF mapper.
:::

We begin the creation of every OHDF mapper by first planning out how we want correlate the fields in the OHDF and security tool's data format. This mapping is important for the following reasons:

1. It gives us a good framework for guiding how we actually implement the \*-to-OHDF mapper.
2. It notifies us of potential knowledge gaps we may have of a security tool's data format. We need to close these gaps as best as we can in order to ensure that we can create field correlations that are as accurate/applicable as possible.
3. It gives us a chance to review our mapping in a format that is still human readable.
4. It helps us reduce the amount of corrections and rewrites we have to perform on the actual mapper implementation due to potential mapping errors.

As we develop the mappings in the following examples, note that we will break down and analyze the fields according to the OHDF schema structures we previously learned about (<i>profiles</i>, <i>controls</i>, and <i>results</i>). This is not necessarily the only or the best way to do this and you are encouraged to develop your own methods for correlating fields that work best for you.

::: info Use of Exported Security Tool Data
The following examples will use generated instances of exported security tool data that do not reflect the entirety of the schemas they are based on. Ideally, you will want to use the full schema when creating a mapping; however, the full schema is always not readily available. To reflect this, we will be using generated export data and will fill in missing schema data when possible.

## Mapping Demo - GoSec

### 1. Breaking Down the Data

Let's first start with our GoSec sample, which you should be already familiar with:

::: details GoSec Source Data

```json
{
  "Golang errors": {},
  "Issues": [
    {
      "severity": "MEDIUM",
      "confidence": "HIGH",
      "cwe": {
        "id": "22",
        "url": "https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html"
      },
      "rule_id": "G304",
      "details": "Potential file inclusion via variable",
      "file": "C:\\Users\\AGILLUM\\OneDrive - The MITRE Corporation\\Documents\\Code\\grype-0.34.4\\internal\\file\\tar.go",
      "code": "82: \t\tcase tar.TypeReg:\n83: \t\t\tf, err := os.OpenFile(target, os.O_CREATE|os.O_RDWR, os.FileMode(header.Mode))\n84: \t\t\tif err != nil {\n",
      "line": "83",
      "column": "14",
      "nosec": false,
      "suppressions": null
    }
  ],
  "Stats": {
    "files": 199,
    "lines": 12401,
    "nosec": 0,
    "found": 7
  },
  "GosecVersion": "dev"
}
```

:::

We can begin our mapping process by identifying the purpose of each field in the source data. This is relatively simple in this case as we have a [formal schema for GoSec](https://github.com/securego/gosec/blob/master/issue/issue.go) that defines many of its fields. While we do this, it's also important that we try to tie back each identified purpose to the three general OHDF schema structures that we learned about earlier; that is, in addition to finding the purpose of each field, we should also ask ourselves the following:

- Is this field recording metadata?
- Is this field recording requirements?
- Is this field recording requirement testing?

Let's apply this to our GoSec source data. Try to find the answers to these two questions for each field yourself and then refer back to our annotated solution to check your work.

::: details GoSec Annotated Source Data

```

:::

Note that this process is subjective and your answers may vary from ours. Don't be so quick to backtrack on your own answers, as your solutions may be as equally valid as ours. There is no objective answer to this process and what's important is that you can identify and break down the source data into useful pieces that we can correlate back to the OHDF schema.

The purpose of this annotation is to understand the intention of the security tool that produced the source data. By breaking down the source data field by field, we can gain a better understanding of how the security tool structures its export data and intends for it to be read by a user. GoSec, for example, organizes its data by security issues because GoSec is intended for code correction and hardening. This manifests in the real world through the user reading the GoSec report issue by issue and solving them as they go along. We can use this knowledge to help guide us in both correlating the schemas and reconfiguring the structure of the source data to fit OHDF.

### 2. Correlating the Schemas

Now that we're familiar with the specifics of the GoSec schema, we can begin to map these fields to the OHDF schema. We'll do this by taking a field in the source data and correlating it to the most applicable OHDF schema field. While performing these correlations, it is important to account for the intention and structure of the source data schema.

This initial mapping is informal and does not need to adhere to any programming syntax since you're probably annotating the documents by hand. The mapping process entails taking the full field path from the source data and placing it as the corresponding value for the OHDF schema field. Proper implementation of these mappings will be done later in the course. An example of such mapping is as follows:

```typescript
{
  profiles: [
    {
      controls: [
        {
          title: Issues.details,
        },
      ],
    },
  ];
}
```

This shows us a mapping of the field `Issues.details` from the source data to the field `profiles.controls.title` in OHDF.

Note that sometimes every relevant field within the OHDF schema is addressed, but the source data still contains unmapped data. In such an event, it is good practice to ensure that such data is still passed through to and recorded somewhere within the OHDF schema for data preservation. In most cases, you should place such data in the `passthrough` field.

Let's first start with an empty OHDF schema as follows:

::: details Empty OHDF Schema

```typescript
{
  platform: {
    name,
    release,
    target_id
  },
  version,
  statistics: {

  profiles: [
    {
      name,
      version,

      title,

      supports,
      attributes,
      groups,
      controls: [
        {
          id,
          title,
          desc,
          descriptions,
          impact,
          refs,
          tags,
          code,
          source_location,
          results: [
            {
              status,
              code_desc,
              message,
              run_time,
              start_time
            }
          ]
        },
      ],
      status
    },
  ],
  passthrough: {
    auxiliary_data: [
      {
        name,
        data
      },
    ],
    raw
  }
}

#### Mapping Version 1

We can begin our schema correlation by directly porting over fields from the GoSec source data that are obvious: `GosecVersion`, `Issues.rule_id`, `Issues.details`, and `Issues.cwe`. Try to map these fields youself as you follow along and refer to our solution to check your work.

::: details Reasoning

- `version: GosecVersion`: We want to specifically place this in `version` in `profiles` because this is metadata on the actual security tool that generated these results. This is different from `version` on the top level since that refers to the platform, or the tool creating the actual OHDF file itself.

- `id: Issues.rule_id`: `rule_id` gives us an ID used by GoSec to identify each failing requirement in the source code.

- `title: Issues.details`: The source data doesn't provide a proper title that goes along with the failing requirement. In lieu of this, we can use `Issues.details` which does give us a human readable description of the requirement and repurpose it as a title for our control.

- `tags: {Issues.cwe}`: `Issues.cwe` provides an association of our GoSec security issue with a known vulnerability database. This can be used in `tags` to act as metadata which can used to filter or organize controls created from these GoSec security issues.

:::

::: details Reasoning

- `code_desc: Issues.code`: `Issues.code` refers to the source code that is explicitly failing the GoSec requirement. This does not align with our definition for `code_desc` but remember that we always aim to seek parity with the original security tool. GoSec focuses heavily on identifying a security issue and directly pinpointing where that issue occurs for immediate resolution. We want to mirror that behavior by also pinpointing where the security issue occurs at instead of providing a code description of what test went wrong.

::: details Reasoning
We map these fields to `tags` in the OHDF schema due to each of these fields acting as descriptive traits of the control which we can categorize and sort the controls by.

It may be tempting to map `Issues.severity` to `impact`; however, it is important to note that `severity` is not the same as `impact`. These two fields are related but distinct metrics, and while conversion is possible, it is not performed in this case due to uncertainty on how to translate the two metrics properly.

:::

::: details Reasoning
This is a situation similar to the one `Issues.code` is in. `Issues.file`, `Issues.line`, and `Issues.column` do not fit the definition given for `message` (i.e., they are not explanations for the test status); however, they do elaborate upon the location of the offending code snippet identified by GoSec, which we want to seek parity with. Thus, in lieu of any suitable substitutes, we instead use the locational information of the failing source code snippet as a description for the control result.

```

:::

::: details Reasoning
For these fields, we can place them in `passthrough` as there are no reasonably applicable fields in the OHDF schema to place them in.

`Golang errors` is not used anywhere in `controls` as it is a description of compilation errors which would've already been flagged by GoSec as security issues if they already occurred. Thus, to avoid duplication, `Golang errors` is omitted from the main OHDF structures.

::: details Reasoning
Unfilled fields are a result of a lack of sufficent information from the source data that can be used to reasonably associate with these fields.

The reasoning for the filled fields are as follows:

- `platform: {name: 'Heimdall Tools'}`: `platform` refers to the instance generating the OHDF file, which in this case is Heimdall2 or Heimdall Tools.

- `platform: {release: HeimdallToolsVersion}`: Similar reasoning as above.

- `version: HeimdallToolsVersion`: Similar reasoning as `platform` fields.

- `name: 'Gosec scanner'`: `profiles` refers to the security tool that generated the original source data. In this case, it is the GoSec security scanning tool.

- `title: 'gosec'`: We can give a succinct title for the profile here.

- `impact: 0.5`: We use a default value of `0.5` since we do not have a direct mapping set up to convert the `Issues.severity` field.

- `status: 'failed'`: GoSec only reports security vulnerabilities if it finds that the scanned source code has such security issues present. As such, every reported issue in a GoSec scan will always be a result of a failed security test.

- `status: 'loaded'`: The status of a profile is typically `loaded` since it has been ingested and converted to OHDF.
  :::

Now we have a finalized mapping for GoSec to OHDF.

## Mapping Demo - DbProtect

It is also possible to convert XML-based results formats. The OHDF library relies on `fast-xml-parser` to convert these XML files into a JSON-like format for compatibility with the base converter. Let us take a look at one such example: The DbProtect Mapper.

### 1. Breaking Down the Data

:::

You may notice that the metadata field maps corresponding keys to each of the values in a row of the data field. Consider ways you might try to restructure this data, but focus mainly on the purpose of each of the values for now. We will handle data restructuring in a later portion.

Unlike with GoSec, DbProtect does not have a published schema. Thus, we must empirically reason the mapping based on our sample data. Because we are reasoning solely off of sample data, even more so than the previous example, this process is subjective and your mapping may vary from ours. One thing we can use to inform ourselves about the purpose of each field in place of a schema, however, is the metadata fields at the top of the sample.

#### Knowledge Check

::: details What questions do we ask ourselves when analyzing security data fields?

- What is the purpose of this field?

- What is this field recording (metadata, requirements, requirement testing)?

Let us now apply this philosophy to our DbProtect source data. Try to find the answers to these two questions for each field yourself and then refer back to our annotated solution to check your work.

Note that this process is subjective and your answers may vary from ours. Don't be so quick to backtrack on your own answers, as your solutions may be as equally valid as ours. There is no objective answer to this process and what's important is that you can identify and break down the source data into useful pieces that we can correlate back to the OHDF schema.

### 2. Correlating the Schemas

Now that we're familiar with the specifics of the DbProtect report structure, we can begin to map these fields to the OHDF schema.

Note that since we used an export from DbProtect and are not basing our mapping off the full schema, we will inevitably miss some fields. We can rectify this by adding them into our mapping post hoc whenever needed; however, we can still capture these missed fields without manual intervention by using our `passthrough` field to capture unmapped data.

Let's first start with an empty OHDF schema as follows:

#### Mapping Version 1

We can begin our schema correlation by directly porting over fields from the DbProtect source data that are obvious: `Check ID`, `Result Status`, and `Date`. Try to map these fields yourself, and refer to our solution below to check your work.

As in the previous example, note that these mapping are informal and do not need to adhere to any programming syntax. Proper implementation of these mappings will be done later in the course.

- `id: 'Check ID'`: `Check ID` gives us an ID used by DbProtect to identify each failing requirement.

- `status: 'Result Status'`: `Result Status` gives us information about the result of the scan, whether it passed or failed or was skipped.

- `start_time: 'Date'`: `Date` provides information about when the scan was run.

::: details Reasoning

For the control description, we want to give information about the type of control being run. Thus, it makes sense to store the category of the check, and the particular task it was for (whether it was for an Audit, or for another reason).

In this case, we can directly map impact to `Risk DV` because there exists an intuitive mapping: High, Medium, Low, and Informational can map to 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, and 0, respectively.

Note that `Check` appears to also correspond to the `Check ID`, and is a brief desciption of the check being run. Thus, it would make sense to map it to the title field of a control.

Finally, for the details, recall that the `code_desc` is looking for the test expectations as defined by the particular control. `Details` is telling us about the particular result's associated parameters.
:::

#### Mapping Version 3

Finally, we are left with the more general, report-level information from our DbProtect sample file: `Organization`, `Asset Type`, `Check Asset`, `IP Address, Port, Instance`, `Job Name`, `Policy`. Notice that OHDF does not have fields that correspond to some of this additional info, so consider ways to condense this data and encode it into other fields.

:::

::: details Reasoning
As mentioned previously, OHDF does not have a specific place to put information like the `Organization`, `Asset`, or `Asset Type`. However, we do have a summary field for profiles. Recall our goal of preserving as much data as possible from the source. With this in mind, it would be reasonable to map all these fields to the summary for the sake of preservation.

The profile name and title fields are a little tricky. Note that the `Policy` field refers to the baseline guidance that the scan tested against. This aligns more with the profile name than the `Job Name`, which is just a name the customer added for the report. Thus, we map the `Policy` field to the `profiles.name` and the `Job Name` field to the `profiles.title` instead.

```

:::

::: details Reasoning
Unfilled fields are a result of a lack of sufficent information from the source data that can be used to reasonably associate with these fields.

The reasoning for the filled fields are as follows:

- `platform: {name: 'Heimdall Tools'}`: `platform` refers to the instance generating the OHDF file, which in this case is Heimdall2 or Heimdall Tools.

- `platform: {release: HeimdallToolsVersion}`: Similar reasoning as above.

- `version: HeimdallToolsVersion`: Similar reasoning as `platform` fields.

- `profiles.controls.tags.nist: DEFAULT_STATIC_CODE_ANALYSIS_NIST_TAGS`: The DbProtect sample does not have any associated NIST tags within it. Thus, we use the default tags for a static code analysis.

- `profiles.controls.tags.cci: DEFAULT_STATIC_CODE_ANALYSIS_CCI_TAGS`: Similar reasoning as above.

- `status: 'loaded'`: The status of a profile is typically `loaded` since it has been ingested and converted to OHDF.
  :::

Now we have a finalized mapping for DbProtect to OHDF.
