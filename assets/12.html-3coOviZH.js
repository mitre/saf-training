Let&#39;s imagine that our team has completed the process of tailoring each SRG requirement into a STIG requirment, and that each requirement has been peer reviewed. Perhaps we have even already created some automation for these requirements. In other words, we have a complete security guidance document!</p><p>Let&#39;s discuss what we can do with our components after we finish the requirement writing and reviewing.</p><h2 id="_12-2-exporting-the-guidance-document" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_12-2-exporting-the-guidance-document"><span>12.2 Exporting the Guidance Document</span></a></h2><p>We have a few ways of exporting the content from Vulcan once it is written.</p><p>Use the &quot;Projects&quot; link in the Vulcan navbar to return to the projects list page. Then click on your RHEL9 project to return to your project view.</p><figure><img src="'+i+'" alt="Updated Project" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Updated Project</figcaption></figure><p>On the right-hand side, the overall project summary now reflects that we made edits.

Requirements are only locked from further editing when they have undergone peer review, or when someone with administrator permissions locks a requirement regardless of review status. Note that even admins cannot lock a requirement unless it at least has a status determination (i.e. it is set to a status other than &quot;Not Yet Determined,&quot; so we cannot lock our RHEL9 component just yet). Therefore, releasing a component should only happen when all authorship is complete.</p><div class="hint-container tip"><p class="hint-container-title">Importing a Released Component</p><p>Once a Component is released, it can be imported into a different Vulcan project as a building block.</p><p>One of our purposes with Vulcan is to avoid duplicating effort wherever possible; if the guidance is already written, we want to be able to access it!</p></div><h3 id="_12-2-2-notes-on-exporting" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_12-2-2-notes-on-exporting"><span>12.2.2 Notes on Exporting</span></a></h3><p>Unlike a formal release, the Component does not need to be locked to be exported (in any format). You are not required to keep your editing workflow inside Vulcan (though we do, of course, recommend keeping your workflow inside Vulcan where you can).</p><div class="hint-container note"><p class="hint-container-title">Note</p><p>This means, for example, that we can export our InSpec profile regularly to test our code against test systems throughout the authorship process.</p><p>We can also export the InSpec profile for a Component even if we haven&#39;t written a single line of InSpec code for it. Recall that Vulcan can automatically use our security documentation to create metadata for automated tests. Exporting the profile will give you a &quot;skeleton&quot; profile that has files for each requirement with the metadata tags applied correctly; this alone can be a huge time saver!</p></div><h2 id="_12-3-diff-viewer" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_12-3-diff-viewer"><span>12.3 Diff Viewer</span></a></h2><p>We have spent quite a bit of time discussing how to use Vulcan to make initial authorship easier.

We can, however, create a Duplicate of the component. Let&#39;s do that now.</p><div class="hint-container note"><p class="hint-container-title">Why are we duplicating the Component?</p><p>In a complex system with many software components, it may make sense to create multiple Components in one project, all of which have a shared source SRG.</p><p>For this example, we are duplicating the Component to mimic the release process.</p></div><p>Click the &quot;Duplicate the Component&quot; button on your Component for RHEL9.

Any will do.</p><figure><img src="'+p+'" alt="Editing the Duplicate" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Editing the Duplicate</figcaption></figure><p>Save the edit, just like you would in the first release.

This is why the Diff viewer shows no InSpec code in the V1R1 version of the document, and why it believes that <em>every</em> requirement has a change. Note also that we are actually comparing the InSpec code for each requirement so that we can take advantage of the style of comparison used by code editors.</p><div class="hint-container tip"><p class="hint-container-title">How do I use this?</p><p>The Diff Viewer&#39;s main use is for comparing completed released components. You can compare releases to tell at a glance what has changed in a piece of guidance, which traditionally would require tracking everything in a changelog manually.</p></div><p>At this point, we have gone over most of the processes you would use in Vulcan to develop your own security guidance content.
