It integrates easily with orchestration and configuration management tools commonly used in the DevOps world.</p><p>As shown in the picture below, the process for developing automated security tests starts with human-language requirements documents like SRGs, STIGs, or CIS Benchmarks and then implements them as code. We need that code to record test results in a standardized format so that we can easily export our security data to a place where people can use it to make decisions (like the Heimdall visualization app).</p><p>This challenge is what the <a href="https://saf.mitre.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MITRE Security Automation Framework</a> or MITRE SAF was developed to simplify -- to make the journey from a Requirement Document to an automated test profile and back again a little easier to navigate.</p><figure><img src="'+a+'" alt="The SAF Lifecycle" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>The SAF Lifecycle</figcaption></figure><h2 id="_1-4-where-can-i-start-on-my-own" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-4-where-can-i-start-on-my-own"><span>1.4 Where can I start on my own?</span></a></h2><p>You can contribute to existing profiles that can be found here:<br><a href="https://github.com/mitre" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/mitre</a></p><p>Alternatively, you can create your own profiles if they don&#39;t exist using the following security guidelines:<br><a href="https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/downloads/</a><br><a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/</a></p>',8))])}const v=n(d,[["render",u]]),b=JSON.parse('{"path":"/courses/advanced/","title":"1.
