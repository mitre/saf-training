We need that code to record test results in a standardized format so that we can easily export our security data somewhere people can use it to make decisions (like the Heimdall visualization app, which we will discuss later).</p><p>This challenge is what the <a href="https://saf.mitre.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MITRE SAF (Security Automation Framework)</a> was developed to simplify -- to make the journey from a security guidance document to an automated test profile to a report on security posture easier to navigate.</p><figure><img src="'+a+'" alt="The SAF Lifecycle" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>The SAF Lifecycle</figcaption></figure><p>We hope that during this class you will become comfortable with the tools, parts, and processes involved in the end-to-end process, and gain the confidence to start automating your compliance journey with the information presented here.</p><p>Let&#39;s get started!</p>',7))])}const v=n(u,[["render",d]]),w=JSON.parse('{"path":"/courses/beginner/","title":"1.
