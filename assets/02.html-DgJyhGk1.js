Creating a Codespace creates a new virtual machine in GitHub&#39;s cloud that is prepopulated with that repository&#39;s code. The user can then access a Virtual Studio window in their browser that points to this virtual machine.</p><p>Overall, Codespaces allow for a user to make a few clicks on a repository&#39;s page and get a simple way to view and edit code, with no local dependencies required, since all the compute is happening in GitHub&#39;s cloud.</p><h2 id="why-codespaces" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-codespaces"><span>Why Codespaces?</span></a></h2><p>Using a Codespace means that we, the instructors, can know for certain what capabilities and tools are available to the students in their development environments. It allows us to standardize the lab experience. If you&#39;re formally taking our classes, we will be using this method to do the exercises. If you are taking the classes as a self-taught experience, we still recommend you create a Codespace and follow along.</p><h2 id="how-do-i-launch-a-codespace-for-my-lab-environment" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-do-i-launch-a-codespace-for-my-lab-environment"><span>How do I launch a Codespace for my lab environment?</span></a></h2><p>You&#39;ll need to create a fork of the <a href="https://github.com/mitre/saf-training-lab-environment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAF training lab environment repository</a>.
