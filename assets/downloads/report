Verify all accounts on the system are assigned to an active system,
application, or user account.

    Obtain the list of authorized system accounts from the Information System
Security Officer (ISSO).

    Check the system accounts on the system with the following command:

    $ sudo more /etc/passwd

    root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
    bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/sbin/nologin
    daemon:x:2:2:daemon:/sbin:/sbin/nologin
    sync:x:5:0:sync:/sbin:/bin/sync
    shutdown:x:6:0:shutdown:/sbin:/sbin/shutdown
    halt:x:7:0:halt:/sbin:/sbin/halt
    games:x:12:100:games:/usr/games:/sbin/nologin
    gopher:x:13:30:gopher:/var/gopher:/sbin/nologin

    Accounts such as "games" and "gopher" are not authorized accounts as
they do not support authorized system functions.

    If the accounts on the system do not match the provided documentation, or
accounts that do not support an authorized system function are present, this is
a finding.

```

games:x:12:100:games:/usr/games:/sbin/nologin
scsaustin:x:1001:1001:scsaustin:/home/scsaustin:/bin/bash
djohnson:x:1002:1002:djohnson:/home/djohnson:/bin/bash

Interactive user account, generally will have a user identifier (UID) of 1000 or greater, a home directory in a specific partition, and an interactive shell.

Obtain the list of interactive user accounts authorized to be on the system from the system administrator or information system security officer (ISSO) and compare it to the list of local interactive user accounts on the system.

If there are unauthorized local user accounts on the system, this is a finding.

An operating system release is considered "supported" if the vendor continues to provide security patches for the product. With an unsupported release, it will not be possible to resolve security issues discovered in the system software.

  Red Hat offers the Extended Update Support (EUS) add-on to a Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription, for a fee, for those customers who wish to standardize on a specific minor release for an extended period. The RHEL 8 minor releases eligible for EUS are 8.1, 8.2, 8.4, 8.6, and 8.8. Each RHEL 8 EUS stream is available for 24 months from the availability of the minor release. RHEL 8.10 will be the final minor release overall. For more details on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle  visit https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.

  Note: The life-cycle time spans and dates are subject to adjustment.

Timely patching is critical for maintaining the operational
    availability, confidentiality, and integrity of information technology (IT)
    systems. However, failure to keep operating system and application software
    patched is a common mistake made by IT professionals. New patches are released
    daily, and it is often difficult for even experienced System Administrators to
    keep abreast of all the new patches. When new weaknesses in an operating system
    exist, patches are usually made available by the vendor to resolve the
    problems. If the most recent security patches and updates are not installed,
    unauthorized users may take advantage of weaknesses in the unpatched software.
    The lack of prompt attention to patching could result in a system compromise.

Use of weak or untested encryption algorithms undermines the purposes of using encryption to protect data. The operating system must implement cryptographic modules adhering to the higher standards approved by the federal government since this provides assurance they have been tested and validated.

RHEL 8 utilizes GRUB 2 as the default bootloader. Note that GRUB 2 command-line parameters are defined in the "kernelopts" variable of the /boot/grub2/grubenv file for all kernel boot entries. The command "fips-mode-setup" modifies the "kernelopts" variable, which in turn updates all kernel boot entries.

The fips=1 kernel option needs to be added to the kernel command line during system installation so that key generation is done with FIPS-approved algorithms and continuous monitoring tests in place. Users must also ensure the system has plenty of entropy during the installation process by moving the mouse around, or if no mouse is available, ensuring that many keystrokes are typed. The recommended amount of keystrokes is 256 and more. Less than 256 keystrokes may generate a nonunique key.

integrity of organizational information. The strength of the mechanism is
commensurate with the security category and/or classification of the

Without path validation, an informed trust decision by the relying
party cannot be made when presented with any certificate not already explicitly
trusted.

  A trust anchor is an authoritative entity represented via a public key and
associated data. It is used in the context of public key infrastructures, X.509
digital certificates, and DNSSEC.

  When there is a chain of trust, usually the top entity to be trusted
becomes the trust anchor; it can be, for example, a Certification Authority
(CA). A certification path starts with the subject certificate and proceeds
through a number of intermediate certificates up to a trusted root certificate,
typically issued by a trusted CA.

    This requirement verifies that a certification path to an accepted trust
anchor is used for certificate validation and that the path includes status
information. Path validation is necessary for a relying party to make an
informed trust decision when presented with any certificate not already
explicitly trusted. Status information for certification paths includes
certificate revocation lists or online certificate status protocol responses.
Validation of the certificate status information is out of scope for this
requirement.

Terminating an unresponsive SSH session within a short time period reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of a management session enabled on the console or console port that has been left unattended. In addition, quickly terminating an idle SSH session will also free up resources committed by the managed network element.

        Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, deallocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level and deallocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system-level network connection. This does not mean the operating system terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the unresponsive session and releases the resources associated with that session.

        RHEL 8 uses /etc/ssh/sshd_config for configurations of OpenSSH. Within the sshd_config, the product of the values of "ClientAliveInterval" and "ClientAliveCountMax" is used to establish the inactivity threshold. The "ClientAliveInterval" is a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The "ClientAliveCountMax" is the number of client alive messages that may be sent without sshd receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is met, sshd will disconnect the client. For more information on these settings and others, refer to the sshd_config man pages.

Without cryptographic integrity protections, information can be altered by unauthorized users without detection. Remote access (e.g., RDP) is access to DoD nonpublic information systems by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network.

The most important characteristic of a random number generator is its
randomness, namely its ability to deliver random numbers that are impossible to
predict.  Entropy in computer security is associated with the unpredictability
of a source of randomness.  The random source with high entropy tends to
achieve a uniform distribution of random values.  Random number generators are
one of the most important building blocks of cryptosystems.

    The SSH implementation in RHEL8 uses the OPENSSL library, which does not
use high-entropy sources by default.  By using the SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG
environment variable the OPENSSL random generator is reseeded from /dev/random.
 This setting is not recommended on computers without the hardware random
generator because insufficient entropy causes the connection to be blocked
until enough entropy is available.

Unauthorized changes to the baseline configuration could make the system vulnerable to various attacks or allow unauthorized access to the operating system. Changes to operating system configurations can have unintended side effects, some of which may be relevant to security.

Detecting such changes and providing an automated response can help avoid unintended, negative consequences that could ultimately affect the security state of the operating system. The operating system's Information System Security Manager (ISSM)/Information System Security Officer (ISSO) and System Administrators (SAs) must be notified via email and/or monitoring system trap when there is an unauthorized modification of a configuration item.

Notifications provided by information systems include messages to local computer consoles, and/or hardware indications, such as lights.

This capability must take into account operational requirements for availability for selecting an appropriate response. The organization may choose to shut down or restart the information system upon security function anomaly detection.

RHEL 8 comes with many optional software packages. A file integrity tool called Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE) is one of those optional packages. This requirement assumes the use of AIDE; however, a different tool may be used if the requirements are met. Note that AIDE does not have a configuration that will send a notification, so a cron job is recommended that uses the mail application on the system to email the results of the file integrity check.

Discretionary Access Control (DAC) is based on the notion that individual users are "owners" of objects and therefore have discretion over who should be authorized to access the object and in which mode (e.g., read or write). Ownership is usually acquired as a consequence of creating the object or via specified ownership assignment. DAC allows the owner to determine who will have access to objects they control. An example of DAC includes user-controlled file permissions.

When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects are not constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information for which they have already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been granted access to information are not prevented from passing (i.e., the subjects have the discretion to pass) the information to other subjects or objects. A subject that is constrained in its operation by Mandatory Access Control policies is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of this requirement. Thus, while Mandatory Access Control imposes constraints preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity level, this requirement permits the subject to pass the information to any subject at the same sensitivity level. The policy is bounded by the information system boundary. Once the information is passed outside the control of the information system, additional means may be required to ensure the constraints remain in effect. While the older, more traditional definitions of discretionary access control require identity-based access control, that limitation is not required for this use of discretionary access control.

By enabling the fs.protected_symlinks kernel parameter, symbolic links are permitted to be followed only when outside a sticky world-writable directory, or when the UID of the link and follower match, or when the directory owner matches the symlink's owner. Disallowing such symlinks helps mitigate vulnerabilities based on insecure file system accessed by privileged programs, avoiding an exploitation vector exploiting unsafe use of open() or creat().

The sysctl --system command will load settings from all system configuration files. All configuration files are sorted by their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of which of the directories they reside in. If multiple files specify the same option, the entry in the file with the lexicographically latest name will take precedence. Files are read from directories in the following list from top to bottom. Once a file of a given filename is loaded, any file of the same name in subsequent directories is ignored.

Using an authentication device, such as a DoD Common Access Card (CAC)

    device will not be affected.

    Multifactor solutions that require devices separate from information

    A privileged account is defined as an information system account with
    authorizations of a privileged user.

    Remote access is access to DoD nonpublic information systems by an

    non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for
    example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.

Syscalls are special routines in the Linux kernel, which userspace
applications ask to do privileged tasks.  Invoking a system call is an
expensive operation because the processor must interrupt the currently
executing task and switch context to kernel mode and then back to userspace
after the system call completes.  Virtual Syscalls map into user space a page
that contains some variables and the implementation of some system calls.  This
allows the system calls to be executed in userspace to alleviate the context
switching expense.

A core dump includes a memory image taken at the time the operating system terminates an application. The memory image could contain sensitive data and is generally useful only for developers trying to debug problems.

a "local_users_only" option that will only track failed user authentication
attempts for local users in /etc/passwd and ignore centralized (AD, IdM, LDAP,

It is critical that when RHEL 8 is at risk of failing to process audit
logs as required, it takes action to mitigate the failure. Audit processing
failures include software/hardware errors; failures in the audit capturing
mechanisms; and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded. Responses to
audit failure depend upon the nature of the failure mode.

    When availability is an overriding concern, other approved actions in
response to an audit failure are as follows:

    1) If the failure was caused by the lack of audit record storage capacity,
RHEL 8 must continue generating audit records if possible (automatically
restarting the audit service if necessary) and overwriting the oldest audit
records in a first-in-first-out manner.

    2) If audit records are sent to a centralized collection server and
communication with this server is lost or the server fails, RHEL 8 must queue
audit records locally until communication is restored or until the audit
records are retrieved manually. Upon restoration of the connection to the
centralized collection server, action should be taken to synchronize the local
audit data with the collection server.

The performance can be helped, however, by combining syscalls into one rule whenever possible.

"Fremovexattr" is a system call that removes extended attributes. This is used for removal of extended attributes from a file.
"Lremovexattr" is a system call that removes extended attributes. This is used for removal of extended attributes from symbolic links.

When a user logs on, the AUID is set to the UID of the account that is being authenticated. Daemons are not user sessions and have the loginuid set to "-1". The AUID representation is an unsigned 32-bit integer, which equals "4294967295". The audit system interprets "-1", "4294967295", and "unset" in the same way.

The system call rules are loaded into a matching engine that intercepts each syscall made by all programs on the system. Therefore, it is very important to use syscall rules only when absolutely necessary since these affect performance. The more rules, the bigger the performance hit. The performance can be helped, however, by combining syscalls into one rule whenever possible.

Without the capability to generate audit records, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.

Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter).

The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be generated. This set of events is typically a subset of the list of all events for which the system is capable of generating audit records.

DoD has defined the list of events for which RHEL 8 will provide an audit record generation capability as the following:

1) Successful and unsuccessful attempts to access, modify, or delete privileges, security objects, security levels, or categories of information (e.g., classification levels);

2) Access actions, such as successful and unsuccessful logon attempts, privileged activities or other system-level access, starting and ending time for user access to the system, concurrent logons from different workstations, successful and unsuccessful accesses to objects, all program initiations, and all direct access to the information system;

Inaccurate time stamps make it more difficult to correlate events and
can lead to an inaccurate analysis. Determining the correct time a particular
event occurred on a system is critical when conducting forensic analysis and
investigating system events. Sources outside the configured acceptable
allowance (drift) may be inaccurate.

    Synchronizing internal information system clocks provides uniformity of
time stamps for information systems with multiple system clocks and systems
connected over a network.

    Organizations should consider endpoints that may not have regular access to
the authoritative time server (e.g., mobile, teleworking, and tactical
endpoints).

    If time stamps are not consistently applied and there is no common time
reference, it is difficult to perform forensic analysis.

    Time stamps generated by the operating system include date and time. Time
is commonly expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern
continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from
UTC.

    RHEL 8 utilizes the "timedatectl" command to view the status of the
"systemd-timesyncd.service". The "timedatectl" status will display the
local time, UTC, and the offset from UTC.

RHEL 8 utilizes the "timedatectl" command to view the status of the "systemd-timesyncd.service". The "timedatectl" status will display the local time, UTC, and the offset from UTC.

Note that USNO offers authenticated NTP service to DoD and U.S. Government agencies operating on the NIPR and SIPR networks. Visit https://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/time/ntp/dod-customers for more information.

The organization must identify authorized software programs and permit

is commonly referred to as whitelisting.

    Utilizing a whitelist provides a configuration management method for
allowing the execution of only authorized software. Using only authorized
software decreases risk by limiting the number of potential vulnerabilities.
Verification of whitelisted software occurs prior to execution or at system
startup.

    User home directories/folders may contain information of a sensitive
nature. Non-privileged users should coordinate any sharing of information with
an SA through shared resources.

    RHEL 8 ships with many optional packages. One such package is a file access
policy daemon called "fapolicyd". "fapolicyd" is a userspace daemon that
determines access rights to files based on attributes of the process and file.
It can be used to either blacklist or whitelist processes or file access.

    Proceed with caution with enforcing the use of this daemon. Improper
configuration may render the system non-functional. The "fapolicyd" API is
not namespace aware and can cause issues when launching or running containers.

    A new feature that RHEL 8 provides is the USBGuard software framework. The
USBguard-daemon is the main component of the USBGuard software framework. It
runs as a service in the background and enforces the USB device authorization
policy for all USB devices. The policy is defined by a set of rules using a
rule language described in the usbguard-rules.conf file. The policy and the
authorization state of USB devices can be modified during runtime using the

DoS is a condition when a resource is not available for legitimate
users. When this occurs, the organization either cannot accomplish its mission
or must operate at degraded capacity.

    This requirement addresses the configuration of RHEL 8 to mitigate the
impact of DoS attacks that have occurred or are ongoing on system availability.
For each system, known and potential DoS attacks must be identified and
solutions for each type implemented. A variety of technologies exists to limit
or, in some cases, eliminate the effects of DoS attacks (e.g., limiting
processes or establishing memory partitions). Employing increased capacity and
bandwidth, combined with service redundancy, may reduce the susceptibility to
some DoS attacks.

    Since version 0.6.0, "firewalld" has incorporated "nftables" as its
backend support. Utilizing the limit statement in "nftables" can help to
mitigate DoS attacks.

Terminating an unresponsive SSH session within a short time period reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of a management session enabled on the console or console port that has been left unattended. In addition, quickly terminating an idle SSH session will also free up resources committed by the managed network element.

Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, deallocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level and deallocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system-level network connection. This does not mean that the operating system terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the unresponsive session and releases the resources associated with that session.

RHEL 8 uses /etc/ssh/sshd_config for configurations of OpenSSH. Within the sshd_config, the product of the values of "ClientAliveInterval" and "ClientAliveCountMax" is used to establish the inactivity threshold. The "ClientAliveInterval" is a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The "ClientAliveCountMax" is the number of client alive messages that may be sent without sshd receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is met, sshd will disconnect the client. For more information on these settings and others, refer to the sshd_config man pages.

unauthorized system access via user password guessing, otherwise known as
brute-force attacks, is reduced. Limits are imposed by locking the account.

    In RHEL 8.2 the "/etc/security/faillock.conf" file was incorporated to
centralize the configuration of the pam_faillock.so module. Also introduced is
a "local_users_only" option that will only track failed user authentication
attempts for local users in /etc/passwd and ignore centralized (AD, IdM, LDAP,
etc.) users to allow the centralized platform to solely manage user lockout.

    From "faillock.conf" man pages: Note that the default directory that
"pam_faillock" uses is usually cleared on system boot so the access will be
reenabled after system reboot. If that is undesirable a different tally
directory must be set with the "dir" option.
    The preauth argument must be used when the module is called before the
modules which ask for the user credentials such as the password.

access to the system via ports, services, and protocols.

    Remote access services, such as those providing remote access to network
devices and information systems, which lack automated control capabilities,

    Remote access is access to DoD nonpublic information systems by an

non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for
example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.
    RHEL 8 functionality (e.g., RDP) must be capable of taking enforcement

access sessions allows organizations to ensure ongoing compliance with remote
access policies by enforcing connection rules of remote access applications on
a variety of information system components (e.g., servers, workstations,

        processing of the current file (/etc/sudoers) and switch to the specified file/directory. Once the
        end of the included file(s) is reached, the rest of /etc/sudoers will be processed. Files that are
        included may themselves include other files. A hard limit of 128 nested include files is enforced
        to prevent include file loops.

The "sudo" command allows authorized users to run programs (including shells) as other users, system users, and root. The "/etc/sudoers" file is used to configure authorized "sudo" users as well as the programs they are allowed to run. Some configuration options in the "/etc/sudoers" file allow configured users to run programs without re-authenticating. Use of these configuration options makes it easier for one compromised account to be used to compromise other accounts.

Without re-authentication, users may access resources or perform tasks for which they do not have authorization.

When operating systems provide the capability to escalate a functional capability, it is critical the user re-authenticate.

Preventing nonprivileged users from executing privileged functions mitigates the risk that unauthorized individuals or processes may gain unnecessary access to information or privileges.

Privileged functions include, for example, establishing accounts, performing system integrity checks, or administering cryptographic key management activities. Nonprivileged users are individuals who do not possess appropriate authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that require protection from nonprivileged users.
