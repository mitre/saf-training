These controls offer high-level security best practices, grouped into common areas of concern.</li><li><strong>Benchmark</strong>: This is a set of security controls tailored to a specific type of application or product. These controls are typically categorized into &#39;high&#39;, &#39;medium&#39;, and &#39;low&#39; levels based on Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (C.I.A).</li><li><strong><a href="https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/cci/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Common Correlation Identifier</a> (CCI)</strong>: The Control Correlation Identifier (CCI) provides a standard identifier and description for each of the singular, actionable statements that comprise an IA control or IA best practice. For example: &#39;CCI-000366&#39;.</li><li><strong>Group Title (gtitle)</strong>: This is essentially the SRG ID but is a holdover data value from the old Vulnerability Management System. For example: &#39;SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227&#39;.</li><li><strong>Major Version Update</strong>: These are updates that occur when a software vendor releases a new major version of their product&#39;s STIG, e.g., Red Hat releasing version 9 of Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Microsoft releasing a new major version of Windows.</li><li><strong>Patch Update</strong>: These are regular updates that address missing corner cases of testing for one or more benchmark requirements, or improvements to the InSpec code for a requirement. These updates result in a new patch release of the benchmark, e.g., <code>v1.12.4</code> to <code>v1.12.5</code>.</li><li><strong>Profile</strong>: This is a set of tests representing a STIG or a CIS Benchmark. These tests automate the validation of a system against that STIG or CIS Benchmark.</li><li><strong>Release Update</strong>: These are updates that occur when the STIG Benchmark owner releases an updated version of the STIG, e.g., Red Hat Enterprise Linux V1R12 to V1R13.</li><li><strong>Rule ID (rid)</strong>: The Rule ID has two parts separated by the <code>r</code> in the string - (&#39;SV-230221) and (r858734_rule)&#39;. The first part remains unique within the major version of a Benchmark document, while the latter part of the string is updated each time the &#39;Rule&#39; is updated &#39;release to release&#39; of the Benchmark. For example: &#39;SV-230221r858734_rule&#39;.</li><li><strong>Security Requirements Guide (SRG)</strong>: SRG documents provide generalized security guidance in XCCDF format that applies to a &#39;class&#39; of software products such as &#39;web server&#39;, &#39;operating systems&#39;, &#39;application servers&#39; or &#39;databases&#39;. You can find an archive of these at the DISA STIG <a href="https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Document Library</a>.</li><li><strong>Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG)</strong>: This is a set of specific technical actions required to establish a certain security posture for a software product. It is based on a desired Security Requirements Guide that applies to the product&#39;s software class and function, such as operating system, web server, database, etc. You can find an archive of these at the DISA STIG <a href="https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Document Library</a>.</li><li><strong>SRG_ID</strong>: This is the unique identifier of the SRG requirement. These indexes, like the STIG Rule IDs, also show their parent-child relationship. For example: &#39;SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227&#39;.</li><li><strong>STIG ID (stig_id)</strong>: Many testing tools and testing results tools use this ID - vs the Rule ID - to display each of the individual results of a Benchmark validation run. For example: &#39;RHEL-08-010000&#39;. Examples include: DISA STIG Viewer, Nessus Audit Scans and the Open SCAP client.</li><li><strong>XCCDF Benchmark (XCCDF or XCCDF Benchmark)</strong>: XCCDF (Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format) is a standard developed by NIST and DOD to provide a machine-readable XML format for creating security guidance documents and security technical implementation guides. You can find an archive of these at the DISA STIG <a href="https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Document Library</a>.</li></ul>',2)])])}const d=t(a,[["render",n]]),m=JSON.parse('{"path":"/courses/profile-dev-test/26.html","title":"26.
