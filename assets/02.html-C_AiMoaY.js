These documents are then implemented as code. We need that code to record test results in a standardized format so that we can easily export our security data to a platform where it can be used to make informed decisions (such as the Heimdall visualization app).</p><p>This challenge is what the <a href="https://saf.mitre.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MITRE Security Automation Framework</a> (MITRE SAF) was developed to address. It simplifies the journey from a Requirement Document to an automated test profile and back again, making it easier to navigate.</p>',13)])])}const u=t(s,[["render",n]]),d=JSON.parse('{"path":"/courses/user/02.html","title":"2.
