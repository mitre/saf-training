Then, the minimal amount of change required is done to fix the code so that the test passes. Once the test passes, the code can be refactored to be cleaner, more readable, etc. This is a cycle, and returns to the top to create a new failing test. As development continues, all tests should be run to confirm that all tests still pass!
