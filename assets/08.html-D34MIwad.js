They break processes into logical units and make them repeatable, consistent, and automated.</p><p>Pipelines also enable several paradigms in modern DevSecOps development, including continuous integration and continuous delivery (CD).</p><ul><li><strong>Continuous Integration (CI)</strong> is the practice of requiring all changes to a codebase to pass a test suite before they are committed. CI ensures that any time a bug is introduced to a codebase, it is caught and corrected as soon as someone tries to commit it, instead of months or years later in operations when it is much more difficult to fix.</li><li><strong>Continuous Delivery (CD)</strong> is the practice of automatically delivering software (such as by pushing code to live deployment) once it passes a test suite. This is a core practice of DevSecOps -- code should be developed incrementally, and small units of functionality should be delivered as soon as they are complete and pass all tests.</li></ul><p>A fully mature DevSecOps pipeline will implement both strategies. Note that <em>both CI and CD presuppose that you have a high-quality, easy-to-use test suite available</em>. We will create our demo pipeline using an InSpec profile as our test suite.</p><h2 id="pipeline-orchestrators" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pipeline-orchestrators"><span>Pipeline Orchestrators</span></a></h2><p>We will build our sample pipeline using <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Actions</a>, the pipeline orchestration tool built into GitHub. We are using this feature because it is free to use unless we exceed usage limits, and because we can write up a pipeline workflow file right from our GitHub Codespaces lab environment.</p><p>While we are using GitHub Actions as the simplest option for this class, there are many other pipeline orchestration tools. Common tools include:</p><ul><li>GitLab&#39;s <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CI/CD</a></li><li><a href="https://www.drone.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DroneCI</a></li><li>Atlassian&#39;s <a href="https://bitbucket.org/product/features/pipelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BitBucket Pipelines</a></li><li><a href="https://www.jenkins.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jenkins</a></li></ul><div class="hint-container note"><p class="hint-container-title">Have you used pipeline orchestration software other than that mentioned here?</p></div><p>Most of the general concepts discussed in this portion of the class will be covered by any pipeline orchestrator tool, though they will likely have different terminology for individual features.</p><h2 id="our-use-case" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#our-use-case"><span>Our Use Case</span></a></h2><p>Let&#39;s learn how to build pipelines by taking on the role of a developer who needs to create a pipeline for a hardened NGINX container image. We can borrow the InSpec profile we&#39;ve already written for our container to make sure that any time we update the container image, we do not accidentally break any security controls.</p><p>We need to:</p><ul><li>Deploy a test NGINX container image</li><li>Harden the container image</li><li>Run a validation scan (our InSpec profile) against the test system</li><li>Verify that the hardened image is, in fact, hardened to our satisfaction using the validation results from the test system</li></ul><p>Real-world pipelines are often used this way in a <em>gold image pipeline,</em> which runs on a defined frequency to continuously deliver a secure, updated machine image that can be used as a base for further applications. In this use case, we would take the hardened and validated image we produced as part of the pipeline and save it as our new gold image. This way, developers can grab a &quot;known-good&quot; image to host their applications without having to configure or keep it up to date themselves.</p><h2 id="pipeline-tasks" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pipeline-tasks"><span>Pipeline Tasks</span></a></h2><p>Pipelines are conceptually broken down into a series of individual tasks.
