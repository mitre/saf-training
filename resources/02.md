## Using Codespaces on GitHub for the Development Lab

::: details 1. My Codespace is stopped! What do I do?
This is normal. Your codespace will timeout after some period of inactivity. When you restart, it will be in the same state as you left it. Just click the "Restart codespace" button.

::: details 2. How long can I use Codespaces for free?
Go to the "Codespaces" tab on the top menu of your GitHub page while logged into GitHub to see your list Codespaces. Here you will see all the Codespaces you have, who owns them (for example, you may own it or your organization may own it). For personally owned Codespaces, you receive 120 free core hours per month. This means that you can have one 2-core Codepace active for 60 hours in one month.
Reference [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces) for more information.

::: details 3. How do I get back to my Codespaces?
This site's hompage has a link to "Go to the development lab". [Here](https://github.com/mitre/saf-training-lab-environment) is that link again. Read through the README on that page for up to date instructions regarding the Codespace development lab for these classes.
